"&gt; Fantastic analogy. I gave Lexus a chance but if you look closely enough, you see a lot of the same components as a Corolla/Camry which is just not worth it in my book for the premium you pay.

Well, yeah‚Ä¶

The point isn‚Äôt to be a completely distinct vehicle. It‚Äôs supposed to be an upscale brother. Nicer seats, better sound system (Mark Levinson is ELITE), more comfortable ride, great noise insulation, things like soft touch surfaces, less plastic, newer tech, better lighting, etc. An overall premium experience.

The point isn‚Äôt to look at the door handle with a magnifying glass and determine that the Camry and ES350 use the same so it must be a rip-off. Spend a day driving a Lexus and then it‚Äôs Toyota counterpart and then come back and tell me it‚Äôs not worth it.

"&gt; You know what‚Äôs even crazier? I can actually fit more construction materials (eg fence boards) in my micra than my friend can fit in her bulky Toyota rav. Like what is the point

Ok but this is actually impossible. Legit impossible to be ""crazier"". Unless your friend's vehicle was already full with stuff, this is completely impossible.

Which model years?

Micra used the same body from 2010 to 2018. 2018 Micro has trunk space of 251Litres, the 2018 Rav has 1087L of trunk space alone. That's almost a 5x volume of space in a vehicle wider and larger for fence boards for all the same storage areas. 

That's at minimum, additionally you can utilize removing seats or utilize foldable seats that can further increase interior volume of the RAV vs any Micro

"FIRE now for me, still driving my current car and without a work commute, I don't drive nearly as much. Nearly 250k miles on a 23 year old car and some parts are unavailable from the manufacturer, so junkyards and people parting out their cars are the source for many things. Once the engine fails or I end up being unable to find a critical part I'll get something new.

If it happened now, I'd probably get a 2003-2007 Toyota Corolla , maybe one of the 2012+ Mitubishi Mirage 5 speed hatchbacks. If it fails in 5 years I imagine the 2016+ Prius with a lithium pack or a Prius Prime will be within my price range.

I'm retired early but I still recognize that cars are a huge money hog and I don't really see the outside of my car when driving and prefer low cost of ownership, reliability, and convenience and much of that low cost of ownership is getting a car that has been depreciated down to about 25% of it's original cost.

"It's the '70s all over again, only this time, the Japanese automakers are on the other side of the tectonic shift. Back then, it was Honda, Toyota, and (to use their disco-era name) Datsun who sucker-punched GM, Ford, and Chrysler by building better, more efficient cars at the height of the oil crises. This time, though, the Americans, Chinese, Koreans, and Germans are all leapfrogging the Japanese, whose electric cars feel like afterthoughts while they insist that hydrogen is the fuel of the future.

The funny thing is, I think they have a point. Electric cars have various Achilles' heels that hydrogen fixes, especially when it comes to heavy-duty work, time spent charging versus filling, and the lifespan, replacement, recycling, and resource use of batteries. I believe that aviation, shipping, and long-haul trucking are gonna be the first fields where hydrogen really catches on and replaces electric vehicles.

That being said, while there's a not-unreasonable chance that hydrogen is the fuel of the future in the long term, battery power is the fuel of the *near* future, at least the next ten to twenty years. Electric car technology is ready *now*, and is already challenging ICE vehicles, while hydrogen technology (especially the production of green hydrogen, which is the only way it's gonna be a truly clean energy source) is around the point that electrics were at in the '90s when GM built the EV1. The Japanese automakers are making a long-shot bet that's heavily informed by the unique market conditions of Japan, which is really the only country that's going all-in on the ""hydrogen economy"". I can see Galapagos syndrome hitting Japanese cars over the next several years, the same way that Japanese cell phones went from state-of-the-art in the '90s and '00s to yesterday's news in the '10s after they got leapfrogged by Apple and Samsung.",0.23208784,0.6316363,0.13627581

"Good question and comment. Let me address your question first. 

1. If you are less than or exactly 6 feet tall driver, most rear facing child seats will fit perfectly fine behind the driver. If you are taller, it may be a close call. I fit mine behind the passenger seat (EvenFlo 360), and my passenger is 5‚Äô7‚Äù and it works quite well. No major issues. Once the car seat faces front in a year and a half, you‚Äôll have no space problems to deal with regardless of your height. 

2. I rejected the first two proposed options in my original post based on what I have been reading about Kia and Hyundai. Currently, if I do change my car, I‚Äôm looking at a 2023 or 2022 Honda CR-V hybrid sport touring. We own a Toyota Prius so we obviously looked at RAV4 Prime first but it has a terrible rear seat legroom and just is a lot smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside. We unfortunately rejected it because of that. It drives very well. But so does the CR-V. I have yet to test drive Venza so that‚Äôs still another option.

"Man oh man I‚Äôm about to get shit on for this. I always do when this topic comes up. This whole ‚Äúmy Toyota is more American than your Ford‚Äù arguement is not valid IMO. What matters is the UNION MADE aspect. Yes some ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù cars are made in Mexico but most truly aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs where your UAW buying guide comes in. That‚Äôll refer you to all American made vehicles that employ UAW workers. Sure, many ‚Äúforeign‚Äù cars are made in the US but they‚Äôre all at non-union plants in the south. You could even take your union-made search a step further by checking the Monroney sticker which is usually found on the window sticker. This will tell you the percentage of the vehicle that is American-made along with the origin on the engine and transmission. 

Now I‚Äôll caveat all of this with I do NOT think you should get rid of a perfectly good car because it‚Äôs not union-made. Cars are seriously expensive, especially now. You can‚Äôt go back in time and you don‚Äôt know what you don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just information to keep in mind for next time.

"The division is like a family of brothers: let's call them Pete, Barry, Victor, and Larry. (Packers, bears, Vikings, and lions respectively). 

Pete and Barry are firstborn twins who were just awesome in high school, and many called Barry's senior year the best year of any player ever. But he flamed out a bit after that and has mostly just chilled in a weed induced state of cold indifference for years. But he recently got promoted to staff manager at McDonalds and he thinks things are looking up. 

Pete was also great back in the day, but got beat on by Barry alot and has made it his mission in adulthood to continually kick Barry while he's down in revenge. Pete never misses a chance to shit on Barry despite Barry's general pathetic situation. Part of why he shits on Barry so hard is because he doesn't want to think about how Victor gets one over on him way more than he'd like to admit.  And recently Pete has had it rough at work and needs to confront the reality that he's just not as good as he once was. He keeps trying to negotiate with his bosses but just doesn't have as much leverage anymore. 

Larry is the forgotten middle child. His life has been absolute dog shit since grade school when he had some happiness, but miraculously he still has a mostly upbeat attitude. He inexplicably is able to get a rise out of Pete in a way the other brothers can't, and he actually won some money on scratch tickets recently. Despite his past of a decent attitude, he actually occasionally acts pretty tough with his new money in a way that the other brothers are surprised and annoyed at. 

Meanwhile Victor is the youngest sibling. He lived in the shadow of his oldest brothers as he came long after, and has a real complex about it. He was a star in middle school but couldn't quite ever land the big victories. Since then, He has always been a fairly successful guy, but always manages to find a way to fuck something up at the end. He really fucking hates Pete and his success, and gloats about Pete's recent struggles. However, he knows his own outlook isn't great as he way overspent on a tricked out Toyota Camry that breaks down at night and his lease on it is up soon.",0.054330196,0.6488835,0.29678622

"I'm not sure where the break even point is but it's got to be more than 3. At some point of doing truck stuff owing the truck is cheaper than owning a small sedan and renting a truck for truck stuff. 

I guess you would need to factor the difference in annual cost to own a truck vs a small sedan and then divide that savings by the cost of renting a truck for the day/weekend depending on what truck stuff you do to figure out the number of truck stuff you would need to average per year to save money. 

If the cost is the same then get the sedan and rent the truck. Save the roads and planet for no extra cost. But if it's a savings to own the truck, then I can't blame you for owning the truck. Money tight all over the board, cut where you can. 

Hopefully we can get to a place as a society where you don't **need** to own a vehicle at all. Where your average person can mix walking biking and public transportation to meet most of your needs and rent the occasional car to fill the road trip/truck stuff gap.


Edit: I Google Toyota corolla and Ford f15. Average maintenance cost for 10 years, the purchase price of a brand new one near me, and the mpg of the 2023 models, using the city mpg for both I came out that buying the vehicle and driving the average 13500 miles a f150 will cost you 7107.50/year while the corolla will cost 4139.1/year.

That's all repairs and maintenance and the purchase price /10 assuming you will keep the vehicle for 10 years and fuel burn for 13500 miles in the city. That's 2968.4 that you could spend on renting a truck and break even. 138.16/day for me to rent a pickup near me. So if your truck stuff is just 1 day (boat on the water, helping a friend move, taking appliances to the dump), you can do truck stuff 21 times a year and still save money owning a corolla and renting a truck. 


Tldr: the break even point is 22. Do 22 truck stuff a year, buy a truck. Do 21 truck stuff a year, buy a corolla and rent a truck.",0.15440845,0.76331264,0.08227889

In this market? Probably a brand new Toyota Corolla,0.034093194,0.7780101,0.18789676
"&gt;Yes but the market moved on its own to Blu ray and USB C, it wasn't enforced by law planet wide (you could make the case about USB C being by law because of the EU but still, you get my point)

The market is moving on its own for cars too, alternative fuel options like E85 are a thing that never really took off. EVs were able to get a foothold because the benefits went beyond emissions, and the major drawbacks are consistently improving. It's not like there hasn't been research into alternative fuels, Toyota has been an industry leader in electric hybrids and they were still doing tons of research on hydrogen fuel cells.

&gt;What I dislike is blindly saying ""all cars must be EVs by 2035"", if you're forced to build EVs and only EVs you won't be doing any research into alternatives.
&gt;
&gt;The laws should be about emissions and carbon footprint not about forcing everyone to a single technology path, that just stifles innovation.

I haven't read all the compliance laws out there but I was under the impression at least most of them were about low emissions and not a specific technology. I'll go back to Toyota on this, if those laws are EV specific it seems unlikely they would have continued hydrogen research as long as they did.

&gt;And EVs aren't entirely perfect lots of countries don't have the electrical infrastructure for mass adoption of EVs and there's still a pretty big carbon footprint involved in making them, the batteries don't just pop into existence and then disappear when they no longer work.

Nothing is perfect, even alternative fuel ICE cars have drawbacks. The carbon footprint for batteries has been grossly overstated. They have a much longer lifespan as an EV battery than people thought and when their duty there is done there are good recycling programs to repurpose the materials. Those perspectives also conveniently ignore the carbon footprints left by manufacturing ICE power units, the creation of their fuels, transportation of said fuels, etc, etc.

&gt;What I think should be done is giving financial incentives to both manufacturers and consumers if you want the market to move to greener vehicles but just blindly forcing adoption worldwide is not the way to go

I guess I'm not convinced it's being blindly forced toward EVs. From my perspective consumers have realized EVs are a more viable option for their needs and have been gravitating toward them.",0.15883675,0.7350121,0.10615118

"&gt; Lol so Japan, with its advanced economy, was living off US welfare? Ever heard of Toyota, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Sony, Sumitomo etc ? Most of them predate US occupation of Japan.

That's probably because the USA didn't literally destroy every building more than 2 stories tall in Japan, isn't it?  Not to mention Japan's own history of imperialism ON Korea.  Korea was the victim of Japanese colonization before winning its independence at the end of WW2.  Japan had the wealth of a century of colonialism, ongoing colonialism, support from The West, and also wasn't literally leveled during the 50's and 60's by Western-backed counter-revolutionaries, and you're going to act like ""well jeez, Japan didn't need that much help"" like it's a square comparison?

&gt;And South Korea developed their industrial leadership without US help

You're absolutely drunk if you think this.  Everything about South Korea, from its counter-revolutionary inception to its modern industry was fostered along by Western capital and especially The USA's babysitting.  

When I say this I'm citing:

Everyday Life in the North Korean Revolution, 1945-1950, Suzy Kim, 2013

Comparing SA's history and mild embargo to Korean history is absurd on its face.  

&gt;From 1964, the US and Britain discontinued their dealings of armaments to South Africa. In spite of the many cries for sanctions, however, none were made obligatory.

&gt;In 1977, the voluntary UN arms embargo became mandatory with the passing of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418.[citation needed] An oil embargo was introduced on 20 November 1987 when the United Nations General Assembly adopted a voluntary international oil embargo.[2]

The embargo was lifted in 1990 lmao, you're going to compare two years of an oil embargo, and 13 years of an ARMS embargo to having a nation literally destroyed and then cut off from the rest of the world?  At least pretend you're arguing in good faith.  

Not to mention, the sanction against SA left it as ANYTHING but thriving.  The fact that NK survived at all is a miracle.

"Do you mean the Dynamic Force A25? Pretty much all issues there have been since 2017 have been tied to manufacturing defects. The only real issue with it is the EGR cooler.

I've already written about it rather often, here's a summary. There have been several cases of EGR cooler failure at low mileage. When this happens there will be white exhaust smoke, loss of performances, milky oil and usually DTC P319000 and/or P04019C. The cooler succumbs to corrosion and dumps coolant straight into the engine: owners often fear a blown head gasket due to symptoms but the cause is far more mundane... and embarrassing. So far Toyota has acknowledged the issue only on the Chinese market: there's been a recall, new parts installed, end of story. In the US and Japan this is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but if the car is under warranty Toyota will just cover it on a no questions asked basis. In Europe owners are on the hook as Toyota has been blaming ""chlorine-contaminated gasoline"" and refusing to cover the part under warranty. Weird since this engine comes with a 15 year warranty if dealer-serviced. 

Of great interest if you leave in a very cold area is a new TSB regarding the EGR cooler. During spells of very cold weather, the A25 can throw low oil pressure warnings and the oil will appear white and frothy, like a blown head gasket. According to the TSB the cause is moisture condensation in the EGR cooler, and following failure for moisture to be removed by normal evaporation at operating temperature, which leads to oil/water emulsion. The only recommended cure so far is to replace the oil and instruct the owner to warm up the car for longer. I cannot judge if Toyota is just blowing smoke here since here it doesn't get much colder so it's basically a no-issue.

EGR excluded it's a very good engine, designed from scratch to work with a hybrid powertrain, like all Dynamic Force engines. 

Finally remember: this engine has two extra items over old hybrids which are not particularly welcome due to the need of extra maintenance. The first is direct injection, and the second is a particulate filter. So far they have not proven bothersome at all, but they will need attention with time and may drive up the costs of long-term ownership.",0.73167515,0.25315765,0.015167205

"&gt; As far as I know, Tundra is the truck with the best reliability.

What is that based on?

&gt; But yet, why does F-150 sells better than Tundra?

Just about everything sells better than Tundra. Tundra had one brief moment where it was competitive with Dodge, Ford, and GM, which was when the 2nd-gen Tundra launched in late 2006. It's been the same basic truck since then until the latest generation was launched as a 2022 model, which wasn't very smooth for Toyota.

Even with a brand-new truck on the market:

Ram outsold Tundra 5:1

Ford outsold Tundra 7:1

GM outsold Tundra 8:1

With those kinds of sales numbers, Ram, Ford, and GM can justify investing a lot more into building a competitive truck.",0.049988687,0.527623,0.4223883

"Article

&gt;We are currently witnessing a major disruption in the world‚Äôs largest car market, that will have massive implications for the biggest carmakers as they seek to manage the switch from fossil fuel vehicles to electric.

&gt;Potentially millions of petrol and diesel cars may about to become unsellable in China as the country implements new vehicle emissions standards, and as EV demand booms. With China already experiencing a car inventory crisis, the next three months could spell disaster for some legacy auto companies.

&gt;Auto News recently reported that the China Auto Dealers Chamber of Commerce (CADCC) posted an article on March 23  on WeChat saying that dealers could be left with hundreds of thousands of non-compliant unsellable petrol and diesel vehicles once China‚Äôs new emission standard is implemented in July.

&gt;According to its website, the CADCC had over 8000 auto dealer members as of 2019.

&gt;More details on the CADCC March 23 article ‚Äì now deleted ‚Äì were given on the Shanghai Metals Market SSM news site on Monday in post titled Industry Association Appeals for Delayed Enforcement of Imminent China VI B Emission Standards to Tackle Huge Inventory Pressure.

&gt;The Chinese metals industry publication is justifiably concerned as the inventory crisis will have massive flow on effects for auto industry metals suppliers.

&gt;The SSM article says the deleted document stated that the CADCC had ‚Äúreceived reports from many auto dealer groups that the upcoming full implementation of the China VI B emission standards will bring enormous pressure to the survival of auto dealers.‚Äù

&gt;SSM reports that in the document the CADCC appealed for three measures on behalf of the majority of auto dealers.

&gt;Industry has had plenty of warning of new emission standards

&gt;China released its rule for stage 6 light-duty vehicle emissions limits in December 2016, so manufacturers have had 7 years to bring their vehicles into line.

&gt;The ‚ÄúChina 6 standard‚Äù is being implemented in two phases. The first phase, 6a took effect on July 1 2020 and the 6b standard will be implemented on July 1 2023.

&gt;The China 6 standard applies to light-duty vehicles up to 3,500 kg powered primarily by gasoline or diesel.

&gt;The International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) says the China 6 standard combines best practices from both European and U.S. regulatory requirements in addition to creating its own.

&gt;The ICCT says ‚ÄúChina 6b further lowers the limits by about one third to half of the magnitude for NOX,
THC, NMHC, PM, and CH4, on top of the China 6a standard.‚Äù

&gt;While the inventory crises is hitting Chinese dealerships hard, the biggest impacts will be felt by legacy auto companies who have failed to shift to electric vehicles.
Inventory crunch will hit foreign legacy auto makers hard

&gt;The glut of hundreds of thousands of high polluting vehicles sitting in Chinese dealerships comes as Chinese consumers shift rapidly to EVs. Over 25% of all new cars sold in China in 2022 were electric.

&gt;According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), 27 million vehicles were sold in China in 2022, with almost 7 million being EVs. China accounted for around two-thirds of global sales of EVs last year.

&gt;Although the inventory crisis is playing out in China, counterintuitively Chinese car manufacturers may actually benefit while foreign legacy auto companies sales plummet in the world‚Äôs largest car market.

&gt;This is because electric vehicles make up a much higher proportion of the total production of Chinese automakers like BYD, while foreign companies like Toyota and Volkswagen are manufacturing and selling mostly petrol and diesel cars in China.

&gt;So it will be predominantly Japanese, German and US carmakers that are hit the hardest by the inventory crisis while Chinese EV companies as well as Tesla will continue to see demand grow.

&gt;This trend is already playing out in 2023.

&gt;In the first two months of the year, sales of Japanese brands in China have dropped by 40% year-on-year. German and Korean brands have dropped by around 20% while US brands have dropped 12.5%.

&gt;Meanwhile, Chinese brands have held steady with losses of ICE sales being offset with increased EV sales domestically.
Chinese market vehicle sales by brand country.

&gt;And this trend is accelerating rapidly. EV output in China totalled 7 million units in 2022, an increase of 97% on 2021, while sales of electric vehicles rose by 93%.

&gt;The imminent implementation of new pollution standard will compound this trend even further.

&gt;Meanwhile, the two largest automakers in the world Volkswagen and Toyota aren‚Äôt even planning on launching mass produced EV models until 2027, which is still 4 years away.

*Could the Chinese inventory crisis lead to a broader collapse?*

&gt;The German and Japanese car giants are also two of the most indebted companies in the world, both with almost $US200 billion of debt and highly questionable valuations on their internal combustion factory assets.

&gt;An inventory glut of unsellable vehicles in the world‚Äôs largest car market is the last thing these companies need and with ICE vehicles sales plummeting, it‚Äôs difficult to see how they will survive.

&gt;In Japan, automotive manufacturers and the industries that support them are estimated to employ over 5 million workers. Around 8% of Japan‚Äôs workforce.

&gt;Because of Japan‚Äôs disastrous national hydrogen strategy (largely promoted by Toyota), the nation produces a trivial number of electric vehicles and as a result its addressable market in China is vanishing before its eyes.

&gt;With Chinese automakers largely shielded from the impacts of the new pollution standards because of their early move to EVs, it‚Äôs unlikely that the Chinese government will delay its implementation.

&gt;Its looking like the next few months will be crunch time for the legacy automotive industry.",0.51023895,0.46538433,0.024376659

1. Only use film cams or something like Fuji or Leica. If you have something like an X100 or Pen-F or Mx, get a leather case that has that piece that can attach and cover the LCD screen. If you have a Leica, gafer tape the top especially if you have a red dot.
2. Mind your phone when using it, especially on the street.
3. Mind your bag. Try to use slash-resistant stuff with noisy velcro like Crumpler, Timbuk2, Pacsafe, etc. If you set it down when you sit, make sure you can feel if it's being pulled, like wrap the strap/s around at least one leg or have it on a chair in front of you (you sit on the outer chair, set the bag against the wall) and have the buckled straps secure it to the seat.
4. If you use ride apps, don't be like how shows like CSI show people using ride apps and check the license plates, make and model of car, etc.
5. Just don't look like a wide-eyed, child-like idiot.

  
*What should I definitely check out while im there?*

  
National Museums (there's three now, two in new buildings), Arts in Island, Intramuros especially San Agustin's museum and cathedral (if you go upstairs when there's no service or wedding going on, you can check out the organ).  


Might wanna do a separate thread for restaurants though because this list is gonna be too long. For one, it won't just be Ph food. Manila has more Japanese ramen franchises than the US, and Luzon has more Ramen Nagis than the rest of the world combined; by contrast the US's real strength isn't in having Ichiran, but how many Japanese chefs that worked in smaller, locally known shops are striking out on their own in the US.

  
*What should i definitely avoid?*

  
Looking like an easy target. See above. Also avoid most people offering things by shouting it to you more so if you don't speak Tagalog - they're going to overprice the service or good. Don't be rude dismissing them though because some are legit, but without a walk-through it's kinda hard to show the difference, but just be more alert mostly in touristy places in Manila City (ie not necessarily the whole of the Metro area, like modern touristy concrete jungle areas) and also places where it's kinda red light district-y. Basically if it looks kind of like Madrid or Beijing, be on guard; on edge, but not obvious (if it's too obvious, you just went over the side of the bell curve for being safe); but if it looks more like Orange County especially Irvine, relax a bit.

  
*Any etiquette i should know?*  
  
Tipping isn't an exact percentage like in the US, so in some places like if you're a big group and racked up Php15,000 in one meal, that doesn't mean the tip should be P2,000 or something. But even if you tip P500 or P1,000, have it in P100's or P50's because if you tip for a huge group, the tip is for several servers.

Also clean up everywhere they don't have servers. I always get annoyed that people here typically don't do this...except for that one time I really just need to sit down thanks to an injury and my ride wasn't there so I sat down at one table and pretended some other schmuck's used coffee cup was mine until my ride got there (I wanted to get coffee, but the place was packed and I'd lose my seat if I get up).

Speaking of losing your seat in a packed restaurant/coffee shop: if you're form the suburbs, even if you go to downtown areas the way you can buy food at the counter then turn around and find all the seats are gone might shock you. So if you're alone best go where there's a server unless the fast food joint is practically empty.",0.3858269,0.58210284,0.03207028

I bought a new car in February &amp; agreed to the $699 paint &amp; interior protection package.

I came home, realized they accidentally sold me the $1499 paint package in the finance documents. I have a paper showing my OTD price with the $699 package &amp; what I agreed to with the salesman. 

I emailed the financial manager &amp; he apologized for the mixup &amp; agreed that there was a mistake made. He emailed me over a form a week later to sign to cancel the warranty. 

It has been two weeks, followed up, and he said that it takes some time &amp; will keep me in the loop. 

Do these things take this long or is this something I should escalate? I waited to leave the dealership a review to see how this pans out. Either way, this is $600+ that I didn‚Äôt agree to. 

On top of this, I have a ‚Äòfree oil change‚Äô through that dealer, but service won‚Äôt answer, and it won‚Äôt let me schedule online. I called sales &amp; they said they‚Äôre probably booked.

"&gt;Musk's autopilot makes most people scared of their cars. This is due to the misunderstanding that they are actually sitting between levels 2-3 of SAE vehicle automation, not level 5. He fails to make that clear, and that is a real safety risk.

Have you driven a Tesla? It‚Äôs very clear it‚Äôs level 2. While he has claimed it will be level 5 he hasn‚Äôt claimed it is now, nor is it implied. Most people are not scared of Tesla‚Äôs

&gt;Toyota (and others) are not beta testing ""autopilot"" on public roads with real customers and real lives. This is why their R&amp;D spend is significantly more than that of Musk's.

And?

&gt;Other cars, like Toyota's, do not include full ""autopilot"" capabilities, and instead include driving assistance features that prevent you from injuring yourself / others in a crash.

No it‚Äôs not. Its features are described accurately. You using a feature and judging it solely based on its name Is on you. Quite frankly autopilot is the perfect name.

&gt;To even more directly address your personal confusion:

&gt;No one (no one) thinks they can go hands free around their block in non-Musk cars, because the car doesn't offer that yet

"I've said it before and I'll say it again. The best way to put more electric drive trains on the road is plug in hybrids that cover 90% of the world's commutes in their all electric range, with fuel for the rest. it would beef up the supply chain and put a steady identifiable, achievable and affordable metric for progress as we transition to all electric.

Toyota is right.

BEV's weighing 6000 pounds with complicated battery management systems and inverters that are always carrying a 400 mile battery pack worth of weight is a mistake, and I suspect is just a way for auto companies to hold on to their most profitable market segment (which is luxury vehicles) and hoard the world's battery supply in the process to prevent a race to the bottom.

"I still haven't decided between those 2 yet, haha. But if I had to decide right now (or place a bet), I'd probably pick the Auris instead of the Ioniq for the following reasons:

\- Toyota, and its Auris series, has a proven reputation for being extremely reliable (low maintenance and rarely any issues) for many more years than Hyundai and the Ioniq series. Ioniq is still relatively young compared to the Auris series, and the Hyundai brand used to be less reliable a decade ago still - whereas Toyota has been extremely reliable for multiple decades already. 

\- Once you're going to sell your Toyota Auris in the future, it's likely going to sell for more than if you'd sell your Hyundai Ioniq instead. The Toyota Auris is known for being able to drive for over 350.000 KM without any issues, therefor maintaining a high resale value. For the Ioniq it's unknown how long it'll last. 

\- Toyota warranty lasts for 10 years/200000km, Hyundai for only 5 years (but without km limit). Meaning Toyota believes more in their quality than Hyundai does.

\- In my region, Toyota garages are much more commonly found than Hyundai garages. If I have an issue with a Toyota, the nearest garage is only minutes away. Hyundai garages are not nearby for me and that could be a little annoying in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

"I am going to strongly disagree with you here. A fuel cell requires high temperature liquid cooling. It requires air compression, air filtration, waste heat and exhaust removal, and dozens or hundreds of solenoids and manifolds to work. They also, critically, *consume fuel* and cannot react instantaneously. 

A modern fuel cell system has to filter, compress, and pump air over the membrane. From a manufacturing and control scheme standpoint they are *much* more similar to an engine than a battery, right down to their power delivery characteristics. Yes, fuel cells need to *rev up* to accommodate increases in load. Most transportation grade fuel cells actually use automotive air, fluid, and temperature management components. They don‚Äôt store energy, they *react a fuel with air* to create it. In fact, many stationary fuel cells actually use *fossil fuels directly.* This is the textbook definition of an engine. Fuel cells are solid state chemical engines, but just because the energy generation is solid state does not mean that the balance of plant is also solid state. If you took apart a Toyota Mirai you‚Äôd see a magic box surrounded by *automotive components* pumping fuel and air, and removing waste. The first ones produced actually used a *supercharger* right out of another ICE application. They just drove it with an electric motor instead of a belt.

Not a 100% true series hybrid.

A true series hybrid is stupid because you're eating double efficiency losses using an engine to make electricity (efficiency loss) to drive a motor (efficiency loss) to propel the vehicle.

Only reason the Volt was designed in this roundabout way is GM was too cheap to license Toyota's EV drivetrain patents.  Most other automakers licensed it (edit: Ford, Subaru... the Jeep/Chrysler Hybrids use Toyotas tech but they built theirs after the patents ran out... most people don't realize the Toyota tech was developed in the 90s).

GM made theirs just enough different by making it worse / more complicated to not get sued (edit: worse because it uses an arrangement of 4 clutches which do have a failure history, it doesn't follow the KISS principle.  The Toyota system only uses 2 clutches (1 of them a sprag clutch)).

Looking online it shouldn't be too bad though. Cost to repair is relatively cheap compared to a Camry.

&gt;Toyota Corolla insurance cost

&gt;Insurance for a 2023 Toyota Corolla costs $223 per month, on average. This rate is only slightly lower ‚Äî it is $2 lower per month ‚Äî than the cost of identical coverage for a Toyota Camry. However, young drivers can expect to pay much more for coverage ‚Äî the average rate for 18-year-olds is $791 per month.

&gt;Farm Bureau has the cheapest coverage for a Corolla, at $102 per month for full coverage.

"Dumbass, if your car is out of control you do not have the luxury of deciding when to stop it. Even if you think you are alone and can take 500+ feet to stop the car, you dont know that 500 feet is going to be indefinitely clear and you dont have the means to take emergency action because you are already in an emergency action. Suddenly someone pulls out and you just caused an accident that you could have prevented because you were listening to your inner voice tell you how smart you are. Hell, even the police expect you to control your vehicle and can ticket you otherwise. Youre selling morons on a moronic idea.

"As other contributors said, very similar to my situation. A big part of it is just tempering expectations. 

We have 4 kids, 2 still in daycare. I make about 120, wife makes around 45. Our house was a very cheap, extremely high-effort fixer upper in the Midwest where we did everything except foundation work for ourselves. I mean, pipes leaking, rotting sills, cracked walls, you name it. But it's what we could do at the time, and we did everything ourselves (i.e. crawling around in the attic for 3 weeks after work to replace insulation, learning to sweat copper, learning the permit process). It's fantastic now. We bought our used cars at GSA auctions, we get our kids clothes at second hand stores for the most part. We save about 18% of our income for retirement.

At the end of the day, a lot of it is understanding that we're not going to be able to afford disneyland, or new cars, or name brand things. Our hobbies are very simple - we garden, we play board games, we watch movies (we have no streaming services of any kind, so we go to the library or find DVDs). I've learned home repair, and car repair, and we make dinner-time into family-time (let's make pizzas! let's make pasta! let's grill!). We also went into it understanding that having kids meant delaying retirement, stopping travel, stopping eating out, etc. And it works really well. 

And we ask ourselves the same questions - how does everyone do it? How did they get a new Toyota Sienna when our 8k 2012 Grand Caravan was hard enough to swing? How did they go to the lake for two weeks when I worked overtime to get two nights? 

I think a lot of it is seeing the externals of people's finances, vs knowing the internals of our own, and the skewed perceptions that our parents *seemed* better off in a lot of ways because so many memories come from when they *were* better off (i.e. the kids are older, the parents make more, and thus money flows more freely).

"Because car accidents are ACCIDENTS and firearms homicides and suicides are INTENTIONAL? How do you propose adding the equivalent of an airbag or seatbelt to a firearm?  Despite all these safety features and such, we still have more automobile fatalities than firearms murders in the US, so maybe we should background check everyone who wants to own a car?

For that matter, firearms accidents number less than 500 a year and preventing them would require widespread training of the entire population in safe handling practices, preferably in K-12. I'll let you guess who'd scream bloody murder about teaching kids the dangers of firearms and how to prevent accidents in schools.  What's astounding is that these same people turn around and argue the opposite when it comes to sex ed, saying abstinence only education is a recipe for failure.

The gun control ""debate"" isn't a ""debate"" as much as one side loudly screaming and making demands using the most dishonest propaganda tactics imaginable, and the other side pointing out the problems with said approaches and being told they just want dead kids.

"The dealership is almost always going to offer you a higher interest rate--though this is the only way I've ever purchased--but you can shop around credit unions (search their advertised rates) and see what kind of percentage they offer. Once you've got that, you should be able to walk into any dealership; the loan officer at the credit union or bank will walk you through the process from approval. 

I'd also recommend figuring out what you want in terms of car, options and price and sticking to it. Once they've got you in the door, they (the dealership) are going to start up selling you on options, model and warranty options, so be prepared to stick to your guns and don't be afraid to walk away if you feel like you're being screwed.

"Crosstreks on the whole are a great vehicle. Good ground clearance, Subaru‚Äôs great awd, good storage space and driver room, and good reliability. Like any vehicle make and model though, Subaru or other, there will be some cars with issues. Subarus have a good track record for reliability, and that‚Äôs as good as you can find. Many cars use CVTs nowadays too (including Honda and Toyota), and some drivers are plagued by memories of early CVTs that had more issues (think Nissans). To be fair, modern auto transmissions are also fairly complex with 8-10 gears rather than 5-6.

CVTs do drive and feel different from automatics. For non driving enthusiasts, it might not be noticeable. My wife drives an ‚Äò18 Crosstrek and finds no difference from the automatics we‚Äôve had before (the cvt shifting is occasionally a little less refined in stop go traffic). You can go for a test drive to see. 

One caveat I‚Äôve gathered from this sub Reddit and others: Subarus are not as forgiving on routine maintenance. You need to keep up or be ahead of the manufacturer maintenance schedule.

"Anyone who tells you not to get a car with CVT is still spooked thanks to Nissans track record of making the bombs they call transmissions. 

Any brand that doesn't use a Jatco transmission is just fine. Toyota, Honda, and Subaru all use CVTs, all are very good and last a very long time. 

Subaru, as with everything else they do, does do things differently. Their CVT is easily the beefiest one out there. It does use a chain in a pull configuration. Other brands use a v-belt in a push configuration. This gives the advantage of a longer life span, lower/higher gear ratios, and quiet operation. They also use a clutch pack for better engagement. Other brands feel almost like rubber bands. Subarus don't.

Subaru uses to engines, the FA for their sports cars, and FB for everything else. They even put the CVT in the WRX. 

Consumer reports have the Crosstrek as #2 in the class. #1 is the hybrid version.

"EGR can cause this as well as a head gasket failure. The amount of coolant loss is negligible in the beginning. Other causes of misfires can be a leaking injector, electrically failing injector, spark plug and other items.  The hard part is not having the car act up when inspected.  You have to look for other clues or wait until it gets worse.  I suggest you move to 5k oil changes as this might lessen the oil consumption. You need to find a Toyota specialist that really knows these cars.  

One thing, when this happens on start up, jump out and see if there is white or blue smoke from the exhaust. A sweet or musty smell might indicate coolant which likely is a failing head gasket.  White smoke is coolant or normal condensation. Blue is oil. They can be hard to differentiate from each other.

"Leasing something that holds value like a Toyota is not at all a bad option if your primary goal is to reduce monthly spend and preserve available cash. I haven't looked at them in a while, but prior to COVID, a lease on a Tacoma I was thinking about was something like $300 a month. A loan on that same Tacoma would've been $600ish a month. At the end of the day, I'd end up in the same spot, because as you said, I wouldn't be underwater very long on the loan, but at the time I was considering it, I wanted to keep my monthly spend low due to fear of income constraints. Then there's the consideration of whether you'll keep the car or not. With the lease, I could buy it at the end if I wanted to keep it, and if I ended up not using the cash I wanted to preserve, I could put that down and get a shorter loan term. If I didn't want to keep it, I just give it back and walk away (or buy it and resell it immediately like some people did, since they were often worth more than the residual). My net spend is the same as it would have been with buying it, but I would have had a bigger cash buffer throughout. Sometimes, for various reason, incentives work out better on leases, too.

Granted, that was a rare scenario for me. I typically buy cars and keep them for a long time, so I wouldn't normally consider a lease at all. Even on something with heavy depreciation, I probably wouldn't consider a lease. They're usually not cheap enough to be significantly different than a loan, and the best way to handle heavy depreciation is to get as much life as you can out of the thing. But I guess if you're really adamant about being in something new every 2-3 years, a lease on a high-depreciation car makes sense.",0.2050065,0.66687995,0.12811355

-------------------------

As for OP's question about the design of hybrid transaxles, consider this:

For the driving mode were you are running at very low speed (or just reversing out of parking space), you want to move the vehicle via electric power only, it isn't necessary to turn on the engine for that, not really. So you need an electric motor coupled to the wheels, that can be used separate from the engine.

For the situation where the hybrid battery is low on charge, you may need to run the engine to charge the battery, even if you are stopped somewhere. So you need an electric motor coupled to the engine, separate from the wheels.

So you need at least two separate electric motors in the drivetrain.  However, combine those with a planetary gearset, and then you don't need any additional parts for a complete transaxle and support for all the different driving modes (high speed, low speed, high torque, low torque). You just need some software.

"The internet is predominantly male, and predominantly young. And people who hang out in car forums are predominantly male, young and have need to... ahem...  express their masculinity. So the CVT is a cultural scapegoat for them because they are special, understand cars, truly enjoy the driving experience and everybody else drives appliances.

CVT's are like any other tool. There is nothing inherently good or bad about them it's just how they are made and designed. Early CVT's had issues, we are years and years later moved on from that and most people don't have issues... just like any other transmission.

What there is, though, is a crazy amount of fearmongering out there, and a few people chasing in on that.

For example, there are more Sentras available than Corollas. Some Nissan dealerships are even selling Sentras below MSRP. Yet Toyota dealerships have no problem selling Corollas well over MSRP because of the insanely high demand for Corollas. Carmakers like Toyota and Honda know about their reputation for reliability and thus have no problem hiking up prices and removing cash rebates.

The other problem is that many American buyers only focus on monthly payment, not the car price.

Hi I work in a small mom and pop dealership. Our line up includes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC.

You know how some folks use ""we're like a family here"" to treat their employees badly and not pay them? Not here. Sometimes it feels like a family that forgets that it is a car dealership. I have good work life balance. Excellent pay. Very little oversight. Two days off a week and great hours (we could work 35 hours a week and not have an issue). Paid vacation. 

My pay plan is more than fair. The only thing I have to complain about is they aren't very aggressive when it comes to online sales. I am surrounded by car sales veterans and there is excellent culture here. They call it a retirement home for car sales people. Very very little micro management. 


The issue is my wife and I last purchased new vehicles in 2008. And I think I want a small/mid size crossover. The issue here is that it is a very old school mentality here. My mentor here in F&amp;I has driven Ford trucks his entire life. He sat down with the dealer principal and asked permission to purchase elsewhere. Several remarks have been made in the past about how such behavior (purchasing somewhere else), would result in the salesperson being fired. My sister in law and wife both think it is ridiculous that I'm 

Now I'm obviously not going to purchase a Chevy, GMC, or Buick off another's lot. That would be shitty and I can get myself an incredible deal here. Basically GMS+Triple Net+Rebates. I know I won't get any sort of a deal going anywhere else and will probably end up paying sticker+. 

I was thinking though, since I've driven foreign cars my entire life (Honda &amp; Toyota) I should cross shop them. But is that a slap in the face to my employer? Should I just buy a Buick Envision and forget the others? I have a good thing going here and I just don't want to screw it up.

I recently bought a certified pre-owned car with an extended warranty. Then I saw the error in my ways buying an extended warranty. I ended up refinancing my loan to reduce my APR by 3% since financing through the dealership was higher. I was told by Toyota that in order to cancel my gap insurance and extended warranty I needed to fax in a letter with certain info stating that I wanted to cancel both. I faxed it over about 3 weeks ago and never received any refund. 

I called customer service back and the guy told me that my gap was automatically canceled when I refinanced but they never canceled my extended warranty then said he did not receive the fax stating I wanted to cancel. I have 30 days after purchase to get a 100% refund and they tried to make me jump through hoops to prolong that timeframe. I called customer back telling them I did submit the fax and told them the date and time as well as receiving a notification that it was successfully sent. Once he located it in their system he told me it was never canceled because it was never opened by them so it was still active. I told  them I sent it weeks ago and they had ample time to do so. He said all he can do now is cancel it and I'd get a refund check in the mail in 30 days for both. 

I told him how shady they are because they seem to not want to refund me my money and I should be receiving a refund of around 4k which can be used to pay off my loan with my refinancer. I accused him of hoarding my money and stated that someone is clearly not doing their job if the fax was unviewed for 3 weeks. He said he does not know why the fax was not viewed yet but said he can process the refund now but that I would not get 100% refund anymore since it was after 30 days. I told him I faxed in the letter before the 30 days they just never processed it so it was their fault.

"It's totally preventable. As a matter of fact, Toyota already knows how to do it. They've designed the latest Tacoma with the Catalytic Converters difficult to reach by thieves. So far, I haven't heard of any other vehicles where that's been done, but hopefully it catches on. It's just a matter of incentives. Right now, the thieves are incentivized to steal them and the dealers are incentivized to keep selling replacements. Until both of those change, this won't stop.

I know what you mean about never forgetting it. A few years ago, they cut the cat out of my 03 Nissan Xterra, which I had bought for $2000 about 5 years before. Quotes to replace it ranged from about $1800 to $2200, and I just wasn't about to double the cost of owning that car over night. I ended up having to scrap the whole car. If they had just stolen the whole car, that would have somehow made sense, but the whole car becoming garbage when just one part was stolen, that was infuriating.

"Sorry for the super long post, the summary is at the end!

Sounds to me like you're a prime example of ""buy a new car, drive it till the wheels fall off"" group of people.  It's a strategy that can work well for diligent car owners(5000-6000 mile oil changes, properly done yearly inspections, timely changes of worn components, etc.).  If you're in the rust belt, it makes sense to replace the car every 10 years unless you treated it with rust prevention on the underbody of the car(fluid film or equivalent). 

The thing about car ownership is that they're ALL going to have issues.  Doesn't matter if you have a Honda, Toyota, Lexus, Subaru, Hyundai, Kia, Chrysler, Ford, or whatever.  They're all eventually going to have issues and it's going to cost money to fix it.  

Kia Souls are fairly reliable, I've heard a handful of manual transmission issues, the big ""engines catching fire"" issue that plagued Hyundai/Kia over the years and a couple of other things here and there.  The biggest thing that gets Kia Souls is lack of maintenance from the owners.  Cheaper cars tend to be sold to owners that don't value maintenance as much.  

I personally think Toyota, Mazda, and Honda tend to have the least amount of severe/expensive issues, but that can be the luck of the draw too.  You could get a lemon Honda Civic or a Toyota Corolla.    

If you're not having issues with it currently, I'd look out for some of these things in the next few years: battery, starter motor, rubber components(engine mounts, ball joints, cv axles, sway bar links/bushings, serpentine belt, etc.), wheel bearings, struts, tires, brakes, transmission flush, coolant flush, diff flush, steering pump fluid flush(likely ATF), serpentine belt tensioner, spark plugs, O2 sensors, catalytic converter, etc.  Most of these items are cheap if you do them yourself or even if you get them done.  Some are big ticket items that may have you stop and think about getting a new vehicle.

That list seems like a lot, but that's just part of car ownership IMO.  It's an expensive way to travel, but it's required in the majority of the US.  

If you happen to be in a town that has a good bicycle infrastructure, you can/should buy an e-bike that can haul children and groceries.  I know a few parents in my town who have 1 car + a cargo e-bike, who can haul 2-4 kids all around town(like the [Urban Arrow](https://urbanarrow.com/)).  A cargo e-bike may seem like an extremely expensive option, but I think it's a great idea for many if they live in the right climate/location/environment.  They also have rain covers for the kids, by the way, so rain doesn't have to stop you.  And it costs much less than car ownership year over year when you factor in maintenance, insurance, gas, and other running costs for a car.  

If the bike option doesn't appeal to you or doesn't work for you, because you drive 20 miles one way to drop off your kid on a 70mph highway, here's my recommendation:

* Keep maintaining your Kia Soul
   * You have plenty set aside for maintenance/new car.  Use it.
* If you come to a point where you're replacing big ticket items(engine, transmission, heater core, rack and pinion, etc.), consider buying a brand new car.
   * Depending on your space needs, I suggest Honda Civic Hatch/CR-V, Toyota Prius/Rav4/Corolla/Camry, Subaru Impreza/Crosstrek/Forester, Mazda, etc.  Really any of the four Japanese brands with good reliability and track record.  Don't buy a Mitsubishi since parts may be harder to find with less dealers in the states.
* And finally, give the e-bike a chance.  If you see one in your town, ask them how they like it.  If there's a cargo bike dealer, take one for a test ride with your kid.  See if you can make the ride to daycare/school/wherever.",0.21816143,0.5928003,0.18903822

"Oh, let me make it clear with a few points:

Musk's autopilot makes most people scared of their cars. This is due to the misunderstanding that they are actually sitting between levels 2-3 of SAE vehicle automation, not level 5. He fails to make that clear, and that is a real safety risk. 

Toyota (and others) are not beta testing ""autopilot"" on public roads with real customers and real lives. This is why their R&amp;D spend is significantly more than that of Musk's. 

Other cars, like Toyota's, do not include full ""autopilot"" capabilities, and instead include driving assistance features that prevent you from injuring yourself / others in a crash. No one misunderstands the fact that if you drive a Toyota, you remain in control of your car, DESPITE the fundamental  features of your car that are protecting you.

Lastly, just for you: Musk's ""autopilot"" is misleading to the average consumer based on its name alone (admittedly not confusing to aircraft pilots)

To even more directly address your personal confusion: 

No one (no one) thinks they can go hands free around their block in non-Musk cars, because the car doesn't offer that yet",0.6803891,0.2982148,0.021396076

"I think you are asking a lot from a corporation when none of these other automakers did anything like that.  The purpose of a corporation is to make money. It‚Äôs the essence of business, any company that is going to handicap themselves for the sake of their competitors is not going to be around for very long. 

Both Nissan and Toyota have had a lead in either fully electric or hybrid vehicles for at least 10 years PRIOR to Tesla picking up market traction and BOTH blew it for the sake of making traditional combustion vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. 

I have no pity for them or any other traditional car manufacturer. What Tesla has been doing is not an overnight success story its been going on for almost 20 years now. These manufacturers are crying now because they are faced with losing major market share in Europe in a relatively short time frame and California and a growing number of states as well. As mandatory end of life for new combustion vehicles sales is drawing close (for passenger vehicles in the near term). 

On top of that if they want their share of free money they have to stop sending jobs out of the country and manufacture here. My eyes don‚Äôt have a single tear in them. This money and these incentives aren‚Äôt just for Tesla they are for any manufacturer that can meet the conditions outlined.  Don‚Äôt worry if the big 3 can‚Äôt figure it out, the Chinese will do what Toyota did so many years ago.  They will build auto plants right here in the US and they will bring all the expertise that they have built in the PRC over here and capture all that market share while domestic manufacturers continue to act surprised that Congress was actually serious.  

People have to stop making excuses for these corporations the PRC has fully embraced EVs as the future (you can‚Äôt even secure funding for a new combustion engine plant in China) and they are positioning themselves to be a serious player in whatever market they can get into, not just their own domestic market. At this point they have the experience, engineering and the ability to iterate while reducing costs. Hilarious that communists are becoming better capitalist than Americans. 

I will say this its not all automakers. Ford had seriously stepped up to the plate. In fact impressively so. They are having the same supply chain issue and growing pains the Tesla, Rivian, Lucid and everyone else is having. Manufacturing is hard, getting batteries right is hard.  Supply chain issues are hard.

"Without knowing your income and location it's hard to give advice. Where I live, average 1 br apartment can be had for 700-850.  Local Walmart are hiring for 14-15 an hour, so I'm assuming that's probably the norm for local entry level jobs.

Make sure you're getting the proper amount of taxes taken out.  Lots of people lose out on cash in their pocket throughout the year and then get all happy that they're getting a tax return.  Don't overpay on taxes and it'll ease the weight of your bills.

Find cheap, easy meals.  I like rice with a protein, chicken/rice/bean burritos etc.  I keep the lowest internet package, phone package, etc.  Buy a cheap simple car like an old Ford focus, chevy aveo, Toyota echo. Your insurance will be dirt cheap for cars like this assuming you have a clean-ish driving record. If you need to, you can take a personal loan for the vehicle.  Around 5k over 4 years with shit interest would be only about 120 a month, plus 30-40 for basic insurance. 

Learn how to service things yourself.  Learning how to repair automobiles/plumbing/appliances has saved me easily five figures over my short adult life. YouTube and Facebook groups can teach you literally anything. Find your local harbor freight, grab $100 worth of tools and you'll be set for a while.  People can get absolutely shafted when something breaks down, and it'd almost always due to labor costs.

 Also, assuming you followed the above advice and bought a cheap car, parts will be cheap as well.  A basic pad change would cost 120 at a shop, but $20 if you did it yourself.

Tbh I make plenty of money and haven't ""struggled"" in a while. I just live like this anyway because it means I save up that much faster for dumb shit I wanna buy. I could easily live on probably about half the income I make now.  But it def helps to live in a cheaper location.",0.17080075,0.7193654,0.10983386

"Sure.  

Mazda RX7 - Fairly easy to work on except for the turbo model.  That's still fairly easy, but EVERYTHING under the hood requires major excavation.  I found it to be the hardest to drive fast, but also the most fun to drive fast.  This thing produces NO torque anywhere especially if you're off boost.  The only way to really drive one really fast is to rev the snot out of it.  Unfortunately, you really don't have enough gear to do that at all times.  The interior in mine was pretty ok, but the seats got to me after a while.  The shifter linkage was always clunky and I never did come up with a way to fix that.  LOTS of aftermarket support for suspension and exhaust.

Nissan 300ZX - Hands down the hardest to work on.  Want to change the air filter?  Start by removing the left rear tail light so you can get an 8-mile-long socket extension in there.  I'm being a bit facetious, of course, but you get the point.  I had a turbo car and at one point I needed to replace the hard line from the AC compressor to the receiver/dryer.   The ENTIRE front left corner of the car had to come off.  Absolutely ridiculous.  On the other hand, that car would pull like a freight train at nearly any speed.  This is the heaviest of the 3 cars by a fair margin.  But the handling remains crisp and braking is BRUTAL with a couple of minor upgrades.  Personally, I think the 300ZX's interior is the best of the three in terms of general fit and finish.  But the seats just don't work for me for some reason.  There's a ton of adjustment in those seats, but I could never get them to fit me for some reason.  

Toyota Supra - Of these three ... the best all-rounder without question.  The turbo car is a bit complicated to work on, but not nearly so bad as the other two.  My supra was quicker than my 300 (probably due to weight), but the 300 was faster.  The engine is a complete animal, but the squashy suspension lets it down a bit.  On the other hand, that squashy suspension makes it an excellent daily car in a way that the other 2 just aren't.  The supra also has a really good interior.  Fit and finish wasn't quite so nice as the 300, but the seats were more comfortable for daily use and were still plenty supportive when I was throwing the car around.",0.15315247,0.34558645,0.50126106
"When I buy a car, I buy a Toyota. I don't really care about the 'backroom' of Toyota. I buy that brand because it has proven to me to be good value and reliable.

"Where are you getting your numbers? A new Toyota Hilux is priced at 66,227 AU dollars which converts to 45k USD roughly. The only Tacoma that expensive is a TRD Pro which is 47k. 

Additionally if you look at the UK pricing a 2 Door Hilux costs 32k starting and a comparable Access cab Tacoma starts at 30-33k depending on the engine. The top trim Hilux also costs roughly 49k US when converted directly. I went in the Australian Toyota website to price out a Hilux and while I couldn‚Äôt get a perfect match the absolute base bare bones Hilux (which has no bed) is 20k US, but there is no equivalent to that in the US so the next one that is closest in features costs roughly 33k US. The top trim of the Hilux also costs 49k US direct conversion. So pricing wise they are all within 2k of each other from countries similar to the US when it comes to the base model, and much more expensive when it comes to the top trims.

"Several advantages Tesla has over Ford: 

1.	Ford has a -40% net income margin on their EVs and they plan to get to +8% margin by 2026. Tesla went from -20% in 2018 to +15% in 2022. I‚Äôll let you decide if that‚Äôs feasible based on the next few points
2.	Tesla manufactures their own batteries at scale and continues to ramp production. This allows them to have a distinct margin advantage and  utilize ev tax credit laws that Ford will not be able to since their batteries are sourced largely from China.
3.	Tesla is largely vertically integrated allowing them to scale much quicker. As production ramps all of your suppliers have to ramp with you and right now ford is using largely off-the-shelf parts. Not to mention much of their parts are the same across the vehicle line up (76% of parts are shared between the model 3 and the Y) further increasing their scale advantage
4.	Ford has ~$88 billion in long-term debt. A lot of that is tied up in legacy assets which produce ICE vehicles. Much of that equipment will become obsolete in the coming years as they pivot to EVs and new debt will need to be used to build new manufacturing sites/equipment.
5.	Ford still has to contend with its dealer network which up-charges individuals and is a high friction way of selling vehicles compared to Tesla‚Äôs mostly contactless delivery system which is transparent on what you pay right up front. 
6.	Tesla has the margin to outcompete Ford at every price point. Every EV that Ford sells at a loss steals a sale from their profitable gas segment. Hard to run a business that way long term. They lost almost $2 billion last year
7.	Tesla‚Äôs supercharger network which will soon allow for smart load balancing by managing charging times for the whole fleet (ie. Based on stall availability and charge level able to route you to the most optimal chargers in real time)
8.	The best infotainment system/software in the industry combined with the ability to produce a profitable ~$25k vehicle in about 2-3 years. (this is what will likely destroy the Toyota Corolla advantage)

Bonus Round

9.	FSD/Dojo supercomputer - Ford has completely dropped out of the full self driving race by giving up on Argo AI. As tesla delivers more vehicles their ability to discover and train against edge cases gets better further pushing the flywheel. Others have pre-mapped geo-fenced areas where their cars can do something similar but this does not scale well. A Tesla can be dropped anywhere and it‚Äôs able to navigate
10. Optimus robot technology which utilizes FSD software, autonomous robo taxi network, possible Starlink integration, energy and solar business etc.

Polaris RZR Factory Team - [Blitzworld Beast](https://www.blitzworld.co.uk/BEAST-Off-Road) or the [Smart Feber 4x4](https://carbuzz.com/news/this-is-not-your-average-smart-car)

We literally got the Non-Factory Team version of this in Series 18 so if they wanted to add a new UTV then it should've been something different, the Blitz is a Box on wheels and fills that role nicely or there's the modified Smart ForTwo mounted on a Polaris Chassis which is even more out there.

We already have an RJ Anderson Truck and so I'd replace this one over the Alumi Craft or the Jimco. The 222D is a MR2-based Rally Car Prototype intended for Group S racing but that got canned. Afaik I've never seen it in a game so it would be a nice showcase to a brand we already have. Lots of Group S Cars to pick from but we don't have a Toyota Rally Car pre-Group A so it's my pick over Audi and Ford from the brands we have ingame.

The Celica is probably one of my favourite Group B Rally Cars and a very successful one in Africa but it's also neglected a lot by games so would be nice to see.

Although it's new to the game and is successful in King of the Hammers and such it feels pretty similar to the Ford Brocky and DeBerti Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.

\- there is a glut of the Ioniq 5 on the used market compared to other cars, some of that being due to that many people why buy these cannot handle the loans, so that‚Äôs some indication of the car being priced too high relative to the type customer base and long term value it can hold.

The PP and performances adjustments are bad, just bad. Most cars I've tried since and that are now slower than before the update are way slower than their real life equivalent. The gameplay is less interesting than ever with most cars. I have no idea why they did this.

Also, the intermediate tyres are now useless : under the rain, the rain tyres are better, and on a dry track, the slick tyres are better. And the intermediate tyres now don't last more than 15 km now, which is the equivalent of just a bit more than 1 turn of Le Mans 24 hours track.

"Fernando Alonso is the sensation of the season and in the sports newspaper L'Equipe he has made an interesting review of the start of the year, of everything that has changed in Formula 1... and he has sent more than one message to several of the characters of the Great Circus with whom he has pending accounts.

Among them, Lewis Hamilton, who after the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix came to qualify Red Bull as the best single-seater in recent times , including his dominant Mercedes with which he has won six of his seven titles.

Alonso, precisely, reminded him of those past times, still not so distant. **""I don't agree. In Arabia I finished 20 seconds behind Checo and Max, but he and Rosberg put us a minute behind the rest in 2014 and 2015. After two or three laps they dropped performance to save their engines. He has a short memory, he's getting older""**, he says in the French newspaper.

It was not the only mention of the seven-time world champion, of which the Spaniard made some other observation: **""With a normal car you can see that there are weaknesses ,"" he said. ""Before, he didn't compete against anyone or alone or sometimes with his teammate. He is the driver with the most pole positions and George Russell beats him 2-0 in the standings this season... and he has not forgotten to drive. This shows to what extent the car continues to be an essential factor""**, explains the two-time world champion.

Looking more towards his own performance in this magical 2023 , Alonso was delighted with his current situation, how could it be otherwise. Because he has burned the stages that he had in his head for his journey at Aston Martin much faster than expected: **""At Aston Martin I expected to have a competitive car in one or two years, but to be in this situation in six months is great.""**

The two-time champion has adapted perfectly to the team and the British car... because he even started working on it as soon as he dressed in green: **""As soon as I arrived at Aston Martin, I anticipated the adaptation problem. I had prepared myself. I talked about my driving style, about the power steering. We've been working on it since January and we prepared it in the simulator.""**

Of course, the mention of 33 could not be missing , the victory that everyone expects: **""Winning? I will need help from the Red Bull, an accident or a breakdown, but we will continue to be competitive. I would never have imagined this three months ago. It's incredible have a car capable of fighting for the podium"".**

All this makes the two-time champion think that the change to Aston Martin has been the best choice of his career: **""Yes, surely. Aston is now a winning machine,"" he acknowledges.** Although he also keeps memories of other moments in his career: ""I also enjoyed the period of Ferrari and Toyota in the WEC, winning Le Mans twice.""

The Asturian also sent a good dart to another of his old friends, Otmar Szafnauer, the head of the Alpine team and one of those responsible for the Spaniard not continuing in the French team. **""Surely Otmar wouldn't sign Newey...he's 64 ,"" he blurted out sarcastically.**

**""I feel like I'm 30 years old and better prepared now than in 2003 ,"" he added about that controversy with his ex-boss. ""Otmar plays his part, but that doesn't work for me. Hamilton I think he was 35 when he won his seventh title. The age factor shouldn't weigh on drivers. And Aston wasn't afraid...""** 

Although the Spaniard also wanted to express that he does not hold a grudge against the team and the French brand: **""They will always be my family. I have no resentment either with Renault or with Alpine. I would have liked us to understand each other better last year. In Australia I talked to them about extending my contract... and I didn't hear back until July.""**",0.0071197306,0.2103225,0.7825578

"Each brand has a distinctive image. 

Maruti- Cheap, easy maintenance, will get you from point a to b.

Toyota- Will last forever with minimal maintenance.

Hyundai- Tech loaded and a safer maruti alternative(used to be in past but kia is catching up now).

Honda- Refinement and affordable sedans

Skoda- budget audi

Tata- too many models and none easy to maintain. Safety first, customer experience last

Mahindra- Cars can double as tractors in emergencies. Hype about innovation. Heavy on safety but lackadaisical delivery of features. 

Kia- World's budget brand trying to pretend as premium one in India. 

VW- one design per decade( Looking at you polo)

renault- hit and miss, never know what the top dogs are thinking and feel like they will exit india like ford and chevrolet. 

Nissan- They exist. 

Jeep- less said the better. 

Audi, mercedes, BMW, jaguar, land rover and other luxury makers- great cars made unavailable by the atrocious taxes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Laws are made by politicians. They get a free innova and think all cars the same. Why would they ever make a law which would reduce sales of maruti? that would result in lesser tax revenue. If cars are safer then the accidents will have to occur due to drivers or roads. Which means government will be pressured to improve roads and make the drivers test strict. 

In most of the accidents involving marutis, people will always talk about the poor safety. if a safe car is involved, then they talk about the safety. Not many talk about why the road has no barricades on a hair pin bend. 

No one talks about that stupid driver who was using aftermarket lights and shone them straight into oncoming traffic.

"You are correct
All 4wd 4th gens use a torsen style transfer case. V6s have 2wd, 4hi, and 4 lo. You can use 4hi anytime for more traction and its like awd. While in 4hi or 4lo you can lock the center diff to give 50/50 power front and rear.
V8s only have 4hi and 4lo which i believe is how 5th gen limiteds are. So basicly its awd all the time and then you can lock the center diff for 50/50 power.

My wife has an 06 v6 and i have an 03 v8. I prefer the way the awd feels on a daily basis and especially in rain. Sometimes my wife will switch hers into 4hi when its really wet outside and it drives like theres no rain. I think toyota should have kept things this way.

"I had a brand new Hilux on order. I had paid extra for bed-liner. It didn't get done in time so they have me a shitty courtesy car the size of a shoe for the weekend since I'd already sent my lease car back.

They didn't tell me that they didn't do it at that dealership so they had to drive it to another Toyota dealer about half an hour away. On the way there, they smashed the windscreen on the motorway. This could have been a genuine accident. They then reversed it into the workshop and straight into one of the posts on the ramps, caving the rear quarter in.

To really take the piss, they called me up and told me about it, but then said I needed to bring the courtesy car back because it was booked out all week to other customers.

I was going on holiday so I locked the courtesy car in my garage out of spite and just ignored them. Came back to multiple furious missed calls from the manager saying I'd stolen their car and they had had to cancel numerous customer's appointments because of me. I told them to come and pick it up and shove the new car up their arse. Got my deposit back but then had no end of trouble as they had already registered the car in my name.

I've got numerous stories with dealerships, like one that sold my mate a fake car. When I pointed it out they had already sold his other car so there was no end of trouble trying to sort out that mess.

A family member took Land Rover to court over a brand new car and he was awarded his money back plus ¬£3,600 in compensation so he basically had a new car for free for 6 months and ended up in profit.

I vaguely remember the 2016 Tacomas having some problems, too and that was the first model year of the 3rd gen.

It's a proven track record of being reliable and since it's one of the last model years, any reliability issues would've likely been worked out, and after he pays if off if he so chooses, he can trade it in for the 4th gen which at that point would be the 3rd or 4th model year of the new platform. And considering it's a Tacoma, resale/trade in value should be pretty good. I also considered the new Frontier (Pro4X) last year but ultimately went with the Taco because of a few things: the Tacoma has way better aftermarket support, Toyota resale, the aforementioned proven track record of being reliable, better availability and no mark up at my local dealership, and with the new Frontier being very new to the market, I was hesitant and I later read something about the transmission in the truck not holding Park for some reason and letting the vehicle roll away even when the truck is off and tranny is in Park.",0.33803177,0.6019341,0.06003412

"I‚Äôm not sure of your price range, but I‚Äôll give you my experience with buying a 3rd generation mini ‚Äúf56‚Äù

I bought a 2015 mini Cooper s with 59k miles on it. Oil changes average around $100USD. I have had no mechanical issues outside of a warranty job on my transmission. Also I do have the car heavily modded which usually translates to less reliable. I have put on 20,000 miles while the car is tuned and modded, no issues as of now. So I‚Äôd say for reliability there‚Äôs no issue in my case.

Extra information:
First, if you want any reliability an f56 mini cooper s is the way to go. You get a b48(6) depending on what continent you‚Äôre on. This motor was co-developed with bmw, mini, and most importantly Toyota. The earlier model years of the f56 generation have motors built in the UK which means higher quality.

Make sure the car you are considering was serviced well. A poorly serviced car can make a huge impact on the overall performance and long term reliability of the car. You may be able to get the service documents by getting the VIN of the car you‚Äôre considering and calling or going to a mini dealer and requesting the service documents. Do you research, make sure every service was on time. 

My mini has not been high maintenance by any means. Just oil changes‚Ä¶ common maintenance that has to be done on every car you buy. Good luck with searching.",0.048377186,0.67855865,0.2730641

"Toyota has no intention to get back to their pre-pandemic level of production. 

Toyota, like Ford, General Motors, and Nissan, has decided to permanently limit new car production so that they can save tens of millions of dollars in cash rebates, advertising, sales incentives etc. and keep prices high. Ford was the first one to adopt this ""lean manufacturing approach"" and other carmakers, greedy to make more profit, were quick to follow suit.

You can google this yourself. Toyota's executives in the USA (Jack Hollis), General Motors CEO Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Farley, Nissan executives etc. have all made comments about limiting new car production and never going back to the high levels of pre-pandemic new car production.

Expect high prices, low inventory levels, zero manufacturer cash rebates, zero dealer discounts etc. to be permanent from now on, especially for desirable brands like Toyota and Honda. This is the new normal unfortunately. Heaven for sellers. Hell for buyers.

I've had my P38 for 11 years now. Bought as a non-runner basket case at 250k km. It's now at 390k km, and mainly the past two years have been a bit problematic. Lots of standing around, and everything is just getting old and worn out. But it's still a pleasure to drive.

If you enjoy fiddling with mechanical things, a Land Rover isn't that bad. Niggles will pop up, but very rarely something that can't get you home. If you have to take it to the dealer for every little non-essential fault, then you can maybe see them as a money pit. But parts are dirt cheap (half the price of Toyota parts, at least over here), and they're stupidly easy to work on. And there are many good online communities that have already seen everything there is to see.

For the Rover V8 there are two main rules: change the oil religiously, and never let it overheat longer than it takes to get to the side of the road. Don't let people scare you with slipped liners, it's actually very rare. Most ticks you hear are either the lifters (change your oil) or an exhaust manifold leaking a bit.

For picking up a car you don't know, make sure to take an extended test drive first, and also make sure you have the EKA code (emergency alarm override). You probably won't need it, but it's one of those things that can leave a perfectly usable vehicle stranded.

But most of all, enjoy it! Take it off-road, and you'll see why people live with all those niggles. It's one of the few cars that'll take you to the trail and back in amazing comfort, and will do the trail while making it look easy as well.",0.12174646,0.45768744,0.42056614
"&gt; Again, this comes down to the basic meaning of the word ""sufficient"".

Words like ""sufficient"" are not unambiguous. They're metaphysically contested.

In one sense of 'sufficient,' 'sufficiency' refers to the sum of all necessary conditions for an event X, such that, when the sufficient conditions are present, the event X necessarily occurs.

In another sense of 'sufficient,' 'sufficient' refers to the sum of all necessary conditions *of a kind* for an event X, such that no further conditions *of that kind*  are necessary.

Is a dollar bill *sufficient* to purchase an item at the dollar store? Well, in the second sense, yes: you don't require any more money, as the current amount you have suffices. In the first sense, however, it is insufficient, since merely possessing a dollar bill does not necessitate purchasing an item. It requires something further, namely free choice.

Libertarians will argue that reasons can be sufficient but not necessitating. In the absence of a reason for option X, choosing option X is not possible, because it is not intelligible. But, provided that you have some reason, option X is a genuine possibility left open to you. The mere fact that you have a reason, however, does not necessitate choosing X: that is precisely what is mean by saying that it is left open to you.

So, see again the example of the Lexus and the Toyota. I have some reason to prefer a Lexus, and some reason to prefer a Toyota, and I get to make the decision as to which I will choose. The reasons do not determine me: I determine myself, on the basis of reasons.

&gt;Either [your empirical world model + the conditions at time T-1 before your decision] is sufficient to entail (logically or probablistically) [the conditions at time T (i.e. your decision)] or it is not.

See above. Sufficiency in the limited sense does not involve entailment. If you think it does, then mere possibility or contingency is ruled out from the outset. But that is just a case of begging the question.

There are more options to choose from, besides (a) the will is wholly determined by external causes, (b) the will acts capriciously. To act on the basis of reasons is to determine oneself in a way that is genuinely contingent.

&gt;I'm having trouble seeing how this isn't a straightforward contradiction in terms.

There is a difference between a reason and a cause. To act on the basis of a reason is not to be moved by that reason as cause. To think about reasons in this way reifies them and treats the human being as just another passive object buffeted around by physical forces. But there are other ways of viewing the world *as intelligible* than this sort of physical model. The problem with the dilemma as you've presented it is that it presupposes a (basically Humean) view of the rational agent as one material object among others, then asks whether its motion, understood as just another moment in a sequence of mechanically determined events, is either (a) determined by some antecedently sufficient mechanical cause, or (b) undetermined by some antecedently sufficient mechanical cause, and therefore undetermined altogether. It *presupposes* that human agency is just like every other kind of physical motion (and therefore that freedom in a robust sense is either impossible or unintelligible), when there are in fact important differences.",0.21102749,0.7473817,0.041590776

"Safetywise as a foreigner, you're fine if you stick to Niamey, but tourismwise, there's not a lot to do in Niamey. If you want to head up to Agadez, that is possible, but also a bit risky. The safest time of year to do so would be during Cure Salee. The festival is actually held just outside of Agadez in Ingall, but Agadez is the entry point. It kind of feels like the entire military mobilizes up to Agadez/Ingal for that time as it is a big tourist draw (realize big is relative here - not many tourists come to Niger. Most tourists would be domestic rather than international). All that to say, Agadez/Ingall is safest around that time. I've also seen some cool tours of the A√Ør Desert up there as well, but be warned, they're expensive. Last time I had seriously looked at the tour, they hired a gun truck (think toyota hillux with eight guards with AKs on benches in the back) which jacked up the price. 

This has got long, but the summary is. Niger is beautiful and indeed super interesting, but it's also quite difficult to visit. Niamey (and it's limited tourism options) are indeed doable independently if you speak French, but even then I would advise you to hire a guide if you don't already know anyone in country to take you around.

"Here's something. All BMWs from that 2003 era tend to break in the exact same way. It's almost like they were engineered to break at specific intervals. When I owned BMWs in that year range I would just go to a forum to figure out what was wrong based on the mileage and symptoms. Later, I got smarter and started to plan ahead by reading forums and planning for the breaks and malfunctions in advance. Some of the cheaper silly problems you can indeed repair yourself. But, 2000 per year? Good luck when the motor needs to be pulled out of the car to replace the oil gasket between the motor and transmission. Or the transmission starts going out on you. And it will at that mileage unless it's been replaced fairly recently. Ask me how I know... :)  


My friend, these are NOT reliable cars. What these people mean by ""maintained"" is have the previous owners already repaired the inevitable plastic clamps that crack all over the engine bay (water pump, fuel pump, etc.), multiple major oil leaks that WILL develop within a 10,000 mile range of all on the same models, various electrical issues related to German overengineering, etc. and so forth.  


Watch You Tube videos about the specific engine and transmission in that car. Just find out which one it is by googling the year and model number. Then, You Tube the engine/transmission. You will find loads of expert reviews about exactly how and why they are not reliable. BMW had a 20 year span where they were just not making reliable cars. That just ended around 2018 and it's a well known fact. These days, they rival Toyota in terms of reliability of their drivetrains. To the point that Toyota actually put the same 6 cylinder BMW engine (B58) in their Supras. But, in 2003? They were a joke and everyone who has an unbiased opinion knows it.  


I can tell you want to buy it. I get it. I've been there. Great looking car. Fun to drive. Looks more expensive than it is. But, it's a trap. You're not rolling the dice. The game is rigged on this one. The more you research, the less you're going to like this car.

I found a used 2017 Toyota Prius from an AutoNation via TrueCar that I‚Äôm looking to buy. The car is listed below what market value seems to be especially for its mileage. I found the sale/maintenance history of the vehicle and it was previously sold for 1k less than it‚Äôs currently listed and that it previously had minor damage that was repaired (cosmetic only, not structural). I assume that the discrepancy between that price and this price is attributable to the repair. I‚Äôm going to look at the car in a couple days and was readying myself for the negotiation when I learned that AutoNation has a ‚Äúno haggle‚Äù policy so my question is:

Having learned what I have from my research do I try to negotiate down just a little bit or accept the already good price and just examine it very closely?

(I should also note that the car has had 3 owners and has been on the market for almost 90 days. I also saw the price get knocked down 1k in the week since I found the listing and contacted the dealer.)

"&gt;For Toyota, I think they use super-charger, where the boost kicks anytime on demand, especially when accelerating.

Toyota *rarely* use superchargers, as in, installed by Toyota. AFAIK, the last time Toyota used a supercharger were in the AW11 MR2 with 4A-G**Z**E (""Z"" meant supercharged). Factory backed TRD and Gazoo Racing has their own endeavors with supercharging, such as the GRMN iQ that has a supercharged 1.3L engine that can be found in an  NSP15x Vios/Yaris. Even the 2ZZ doesn't come with a turbocharger and Lotus installed one on their Exige.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...turbochargers, where the boost is dependent on your RPM...

Actually, it's the nature of a supercharger. Turbochargers were reliant on exhaust pressure/velocity to spin the turbine.

This is the reason why the Lancia Delta S4 from the Group B era were twincharged (both super and turbocharged) because the supercharger cannot provide enough boost for the engine to achieve greater power, hence the turbochargers that works more effectively at higher RPMs. Problem with turbos back then were the lag, hence the supercharger.",0.052674953,0.846302,0.10102309

"Okay, let's settle this once and for all.

**1.) Oil change misconceptions:**

Kahit sa manual ng Toyota, walang nakalagay na 3 months, need magpalit ng langis. 6 months na oil change interval (OCI) ang nakalagay. Wala din nalakagay na need magpa-PMS every 3 months, UNLESS, you are reaching the 5,000 KM mark shorter than 6 months.

Severe driving conditions requires less kilometers bago magpalit. Severe, meant, frequent short drives, babad sa standstill traffic, towing, laging high load ang gamit, among other descriptives. Still, the 6-month OCI rule were to be followed if hindi naaabot ang 5,000 KM in the span of 6 months.

Regular oils (will not use the term ""mineral oil"") nowadays were stringent in terms of certification - minimum would be API SP. R&amp;D-wise, oils of today were a lot better than the oils of the yesteryears. Your regular oil will still have enough life even after 6 months, again, assuming na hindi naaabot ang 5,000 KM mark within 6 months. Anything beyond 6 months, then medyo alanganin na.

So, if we will refer on the manual, 2 PMS intervals lang din ang Toyota a year. Yung 3-month-rule, well, IDK sino nagpauso noon; maybe unscrupulous dealerships na gusto kumita ng mas malaki?

The owner's manual should trump the service advisor on PMS schedules, unless there are some other things the manual cannot diagnose, then dito papasok ang human decision factor.

**2.) Toyota allows me to do a twice-a-year PMS interval when I use a synthetic oil; yearly ang palit ng langis. Palit lang ng filter kada 6 months or 5,000 KM.**

The thing is, surprise, surprise... hindi capable ang synthetic oil ng Toyota na mag-extended interval. Yearly OCI is considered as extended interval - another thing na mali na naman ang service advisor.

Certifications-wise, API SN certified lang ang synthetic ng Toyota: NOTHING ELSE, which means, chemistry-wise, most likely ang Total Base Number (TBN) lang ng langis ng Toyota ay nasa 6 or 7 lang - same with Motul H-Tech, and ON PAR WITH REGULAR OILS. Hence, dito ulit papasok ang argumento kung bakit naman walang nakasaad sa manual na yearly ang palit ng langis kapag naka-synthetic. In other words, good for 6 months lang din ang synthetic oil ng Toyota, if we will consider TBN alone. Additives will make the life slightly longer, but then again, still not on par with oils approved for extended intervals, a-la *""the ones we know na lifespan ng synthetic na langis na pang-isang taon or 10,000 KM""*.

So need pa din ba magpalit ng langis every 6 months IF yung langis ng Toyota ang gamit? Better to be on the safe side of things, as they won't provide absolute numbers.

Now, synthetic oils that are approved for extended drain interval has a TBN of 10, minimum. Key certifications that requiring such would be MB 229.5 and BMW LongLife-01. Considering the operating temperature in the Philippines as harsh, instead of a year, to be on the safe side, pwedeng 9 months or 7,500-8,000 KM ang palit, albeit, depende sa langis, oil analysis results from BITOG shows good numbers even after a year and having the oil run for twice the amount of the aforementioned mileage. Then again, hindi sa Pilipinas yun, which meant that the cars does not experience excruciatingly hot temperatures, or sa case ng mga taga-NCR, pagkababad sa traffic and short drives.

To make things simple:  
1.) Regular oil user ako. - *6 months or 5,000 KM, whichever comes first.*  
2.) Synthetic oil user ako.

* API SN, SN+, or SP lang ang certification -  *6 months pa din ang palit. Can extend slightly more than 5,000 KM, but won't risk it. Kadalasan, dito papasok ang mga langis ng dealerships.*
* If may iba pang certification, depende pa sa certification. Higher numbers of version won't automatically meant better. Dito papasok ang forums gaya ng BITOG.

Don't want the hassle of determining whether pasok sa extended drain interval ang langis mo? Change every 6 months.

Other PMS deliverables were done in the frequency of 6 months, so therefore, not 3 months: 6.",0.12808308,0.7979085,0.07400844

Mazda is a much smaller company than VW, Toyota, Ford, etc. They made the decision to move towards 'premium' and less 'performance enthusiast' like hot hatches. The definitions and if it was a good idea can be argued back and forth.

If you're racing there are better cars than the Mazda3, like your VW. If you want a reliable, comfortable, yet still fun daily driver a manual Mazda3 is a solid option. I'm not racing, so I'm happy.

"I might recommend that you also consider the fact that advice, stories, and recommendations for autistic/ADHD/OCD members of the community may very well also be helpful to OE individuals. Neurodivergent *is* an umbrella term for a lot of differences in the way we process and understand the world around us; however, I'm certain that there are any number of fine-grained differences and specific sensitivities that we might be able to sort ourselves into. It's certainly not uncommon for ADHD individuals benefit from tips from the nominally autistic community. And I have to imagine that advice on how to manage hyperfixation is relevant to anyone who experiences it, not merely those diagnosed as ADHD.

I'm not sure if it's so much that the Neurodivergent community isn't willing to try to support you and the specific classification of how your brain works, as it is that the specific terminology for how neuro-divergence manifests is ever-evolving, and it might take time for information relevant to a specific constellation of differences to be collected and distilled for easy consumption. Like several other commenters, I've never heard of OE, and anything I might try to write about it would be guesswork.

In other words, if you drive a Toyota Corolla, it will be incredibly difficult to find Toyota Corolla driving tips. There may be a small amount of highly specific content online about a Toyota Corolla's specific steering sensitivity and acceleration because a handful of people drive them, but you're going to feel a huge lack of information unless you're willing to also consider yourself a Toyota driver, or even motor vehicle driver.

"I drive a 2012 cruze with 250k on it. I just did $3,000 or repairs this last year to keep it going another 250k. I have no doubt it will make it that far if not further, with the way I maintain it. The repairs were suspension parts that were simply worn. It drives just like it was when new once again. I currently drive 76 miles to work each way, so over 140 miles per day. 

I say, if you want to save money, fix it. Its a 2000 so its easy enough to work on yourself if you are so inclined to.  Its also a Toyota, a brand that is known for its long lasting and dependable cars. Also - get a 2nd opinion, an itemized list, and consider doing some of the repairs yourself!  I do a lot of my own as my car is fairly easy to work on.

Hopefully your repairs are to replace worn components, and if so, replacing these won't mean you'll be doing that again anytime soon. 

Who cares if the repairs are worth more than the car - if your like me and would rather secure your future than be in debt, then you will be so much further ahead.  Not having a payment, or a newer used car that could potentially cost you more in service departments, can get you so much further ahead!",0.08644555,0.5729407,0.34061375

"Deep within the winding roads of the Scottish Highlands, a legend has emerged about a mystical, one-of-a-kind Toyota Highlander. This extraordinary vehicle, known as the ""Highland Guardian,"" is said to possess unique and magical powers that have piqued the curiosity of automotive enthusiasts and adventurers alike.

Rumors of the Highland Guardian began circulating after a series of unexplained occurrences were reported by locals. Some claim to have witnessed the Highlander driving on its own, navigating treacherous mountain roads without a driver. Others speak of a strange aura emanating from the vehicle, illuminating the surrounding area with a faint, otherworldly glow.

Tales of the Highland Guardian's powers have become a topic of heated debate in pubs and gatherings across the region. Some believe that the vehicle has the ability to heal and protect its occupants, while others speculate that it holds the key to unlocking hidden knowledge and understanding.

The origins of the Highland Guardian remain shrouded in mystery, with some believing that it is the creation of an enigmatic inventor who harnessed the power of ancient Celtic symbols and sacred geometry. Others propose that the Highlander is the product of a secret collaboration between Toyota engineers and a hidden order of Scottish mystics.

As the legend of the Highland Guardian continues to grow, so does the allure of the Scottish Highlands for those seeking adventure and the answers to life's greatest mysteries.

"&gt;My main point of view is AMD is a better option overall at every price point. Each 6000 series GPU basically performs the same as the next price tier up Nvidia card, while still giving good features like FSR, more vram, much better software imo.

Yeah. I used to tell myself exactly the same stories for the 20 or so years I spent on team red. I was a pretty die-hard fanboy, and was exactly where you were more than I care to remember.

You could also spin that same reasoning around to justify the inverse: ""Each 6000 series GPU is priced under the equivalent raster performance Nvidia GPU to compensate for the lack of feature parity."" 

It's not just the particular software features, but also having the specially dedicated hardware onboard to accelerate those things. While AMD has a handful of their own alternatives to some of Nvidia's software features, they're just simply not on the same level. FSR is nice to have, but it's a stand-in for the far more advanced DLSS. Where's the Nvidia Broadcast/RTX Voice equivalent? Video Super Resolution equivalent? 

&gt;And all of that is my opinion, would I pay $100+ more for better raytracing? Never. 

I mean... you might not now, but raytracing isn't going anywhere, and the future is fully pathtraced lighting systems as we've watched grow from Quake II RTX, to Portal RTX, and coming up shortly is Cyberpunk 2077's Raytracing: Overdrive update which will enable fully pathtraced lighting. And of course that's totally fine to evaluate based on your own preferences and decide you'd rather save the money and leave that eye candy off until a future upgrade. 

&gt;Would somebody else? Maybe, although based on polls on TechTubers channels people who actually use RT is very small.

Be very cautious about taking those as anything more than a bit of fun. The average techtuber audience skews heavily towards teens and young adults who are significantly less likely to be owning and using high end GPUs. 

Honestly it's the first real gamechanger in game rendering in a long time, and over time more and more people are going to stumble upon an implementation that really makes it click for them. Lego: Builder's Journey is my most recent favourite RT showcase. Flip the switch and suddenly the it goes from looking like a game with lego bricks, to looking like you're watching live video of actual lego. 

&gt;Is the streaming/recording quality still that much better these days? Not really, and with 7000 series having AV1, it will be the same quality most likely.

AMD is still noticeable dead last in H.264 encoding quality, and generally reviews testing out the AV1 encoding show it's a massive improvement over the 6000 series, however that puts it roughly between AV1 on Intel Arc Alchemist and NVENC. We can add that to the list of non-parity features for the 6000 series.

&gt;I can see Nvidia making sense if they start putting sensical amounts of vram in their products

Nvidia targets their VRAM to segment the intended markets for their cards, and besides the blip with the launch of Hogwarts Legacy, the last time we had VRAM scares that actually showed performance loss was with the GTX 670 3.5GB/4GB issues. The only reason AMD isn't doing the same is because they can leverage it from their underdog position for improved marketing. The 16GB in a 6700 XT for example makes a fun marketing blurb, but yet the 3070s performance lead only gets wider going up to 4K despite having only 8GB. Indeed if you could magically have an 8GB 6700 XT to test with, performance would be identical to the 16GB version. In all but a slim few situations does excessive VRAM matter - why? Because by the time you're trying to run at settings and resolutions where it does show a difference you're often in slideshow FPS territory either way. A card performing twice as fast doesn't matter if you're looking at 5FPS vs 10FPS. 


&gt;So I‚Äôm not entirely sure where you came up with your last paragraph/statement, but at the end of the day for the vast majority of people, price to raster performance IS the biggest factor

People like to *say* that, but look at the cards people actually buy most often and it simply doesn't match up. It's the same reason we're not all driving efficient and reliable Toyota Corollas, despite most people describing reliability, safety and fuel economy as some of their top concerns when looking at new cars. Nobody wants to feel like they're being judged a sucker by their peers, but you might be surprised by how many people you see talking about this stuff have Nvidia cards in their own rigs.",0.02885332,0.25649732,0.7146494

"The 18 team mostly went to REV Racing, driven by Nick Sanchez in the #2 truck. Danny Stockman is the crew chief.



Toyota was giving them a lot of money to run 3 trucks (2 with full time drivers). Once they lost the Toyota money, Chevy is still supporting them but to a lesser extent. This is why they took Purdy and Wood, 2 pay drivers to support all current employees. Kyle said himself when asked ‚Äúwhy bother keeping KBM‚Äù (this was after he moved to RCR) he basically said he didn‚Äôt want to leave 55 people without a job, and that was a good enough reason to keep it going (or in other terms, they took pay drivers to their our employees hired).



They probably aren‚Äôt getting enough Chevy money to support all 3 trucks under KBM, so REV is sponsoring/helping with the 2 truck.  Nick is Hispanic and REV is the Drive For Diversity team, REV has been supporting Nick for a few years now I believe.

Essentially, the second full time driver is Nick Sanchez, and that truck is now outsourced to REV with a KBM alliance since Siegel has sponsors and stuff.


On topic, I think Sanchez will definitely win a race soon. He‚Äôs looking really fast so far. Went toe to toe with KFB in the Vegas race early before he overdrove and wrecked himself, and nearly won Atlanta.

"To each their own. IMO, it's always better to change more than recommended, than to change it less. 

Come to find out, the main reason 10k is what is recommended is because that is the bare minimum that dealers will honor warranties on. I've spoken to dealer service advisors, and this is what they told me. Heck, now some makers aren't even setting a spec for coolant!

But here's the big kicker: Even though they *say* 10k, the cars frequently are set to a shorter interval. For example:

Toyota says 10k, but their vehicles are pre-programmed for 5k.

GM says 10k, but their vehicles are set for either 7500 or 5000.

"&gt; Does anyone have any input between the prime and hybrid models vs the regular gas rav4 and reliablity? 

Toyota has been building shockingly reliable hybrid powertrains for more than two decades. There are still a lot of 1st generation Priuses on the road. 

&gt; Even with Toyotas long term experience in hybrid vehicles, im still a bit leery with hybrids in general as you add another drivetrain that can have problems into the mix. 

The beauty of the hybrid drivetrain is that it is still just one drivetrain. I would actually argue that mechanically it is SIMPLER than a traditional gasoline-only powertrain. No belts, no alternator, no 8-speed transmission or CVT belt to blow out, no starter motor, etc etc etc.

I highly recommend you watch some videos from Prof. Kelly at Weber State Automotive on YouTube. His extremely detailed videos on the Toyota hybrid powertrains is what convinced me to get one. 

&gt; If somehow the electric powertrain of the car gets disabled or malfunctions, will the car still be able to run on gas alone?

No. The gasoline engine is started by the same electrical system that propels the vehicle. The electric motors are constantly working, with the gasoline engine supplementing when needed.

"I‚Äôve only had my MY-P for 5 days and I‚Äôm coming from an 2018 F-150 Lariat.  Plenty of room for my fat ass, 6‚Äô, 280lbs.

"My wife and I just talked about whether we would buy the Pacific Hybrid again. I think our answer is no.  We actually are really happy with the van so far, but there are two things that factor into that decision:

&amp;#x200B;

1. In our opinion, if you can't get the EV credit, it's not worth the price. Starting with 2023 models, the EV Credit laws *drastically* changed. Previously, the primary qualification was that the car had to be manufactured in the US. But now, you get credit based on *weird* factors. For example, one of the decisions factoring the credit now is how much power the battery outputs. I want to say it's something like $250 credit for every 2 kw of engine power. Additionally, the entire battery and its components have to be manufactured in the US, in addition to the car. Even worse, no one can give a straight answer on whether the car qualifies. Not a single Chrysler dealerships could tell us if our model qualified for the EV Credit. Even our tax guy couldn't tell us ahead of time until we actually filed out taxes.  It was not a fun feeling doing our taxes with our fingers crossed hoping we did qualify. Fortunately we did end up qualifying with our model, but I still have no idea if the 2023's qualify for the credit. I believe they do, but it would be nice to get a straight answer. 
2. If a Toyota Sienna was readily available, we would have purchased that  instead. The primary reason for this is because of reliability. We did a lot of research and read a lot of horror stories with Pacifica Hybrids. Fortunately we haven't had many issues other than a faulty outlet screwing up our charging system, and we had to have the dealer reboot it. However, there is a somewhat terrifying safety recall on all the models from the past few years where your van can just lose engine power while driving. There's been scary videos people have posted on this issue: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ss5Y\_hW13X4](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ss5Y_hW13X4)  
Some older models apparently even randomly caught on on fire while charging, or even not charging, and the recommendation was to park them away from your house. The good news is we haven't experienced any issues, but we don't like having that fear in the back of our mind something could go wrong. Our main reason for not getting the Sienna in the first place was that there was a 16-month waitlist for Siennas, and even then you weren't guaranteed the model you wanted. This was also during the supply shortage, so used Siennas out of the question as they were going for an absurd $20,000 premium over new ones. Since the used car market was so hot during this time, we also wanted to take advantage of getting a good trade-in value at that time. 

All that said, we don't *regret* buying the Pacifica, but we would choose the Sienna if they were both available side-by-side.",0.040095855,0.3469219,0.6129823

"I understand. Here is my advice then: 

1. Don‚Äôt assume you have to get a really old car to get the price under $200/month. 

2. Don‚Äôt put all your cash down. Save some for the potential repairs a used car is going to have. I would recommend finding a car for 18k or under and put down 7k or so. I don‚Äôt know where you are located but take sales tax into consideration. 

3. Gravitate toward Hondas and Toyotas. Avoid Nissans. Hyundais are ok. Prioritize low mileage over year, but consider both as factors. Check underneath for rust!! Check the tires and demand new tires thrown in the deal if they are almost bald. Ask them when the battery was last replaced and demand a new one if it is over 5 years old thrown in the deal (drag out the sale and when they get tired, tell them this will seal the deal 

4. Make sure you check the price of insurance. If you had an old car and only had liability coverage (no damage coverage), full coverage is going to be a big price increase. Check it before you buy. And here is a trick for you‚Ä¶.if you have only one car on the policy, you pay higher rates. Multi-car discounts reduce insurance by as much as 10-15%. Maybe keep your heap to get the discount (unless you can trade it in‚Äîthey might give you some money for it)

5. Avoid private sellers in this situation. They lie and there is no one you can hold liable.

My truck will last me 10-15 (maybe 20 if lucky) years if properly maintained and that's all I can ask for. I'll drive it until it's dead and I'll have the peace of mind and reliability for every mile until then.

I'm not into mods, off roading, or anything like that. Just like a reliable ride that will go the distance and get me through what I need. Great investment IMO",0.00902421,0.15240669,0.83856916

"I have sort of experienced something like this, maybe not to the extreme you are, but with a much weirder object..... my truck.

As a teen, I ""moved out"" of my parents' house before I'd even graduated high school. I was basically homeless, and living mostly out of my truck or on friends' couches for a few months before the parents of a close friend found out what I was doing, and took me in. So for a while, at a very formative age and difficult time in my life, I was spending most of my time in or around my truck. And I have this habit of talking to myself, so after a while, it was starting to feel like I was speaking to the truck. It was a Toyota Tacoma, so somewhere along the line I started referring to it as ""T2"" in the way both Obi-Wan and Luke refer to R2-D2 as they're flying with him. And once I'd been driving long enough, there were moments where I felt like the truck was actually *listening* to me. Like you, I found the feeling eerie but also comforting, like I had a friend looking out for me even when I was alone. And then when I ended up getting hit on the freeway in that truck, I really felt like the truck saved my life -- and in a way, it had.

So, yeah. A lot of the same elements -- stressful time, speaking a lot in the presence of the object, spending a lot of alone time with the object, personifying it. I do think it's just the brain's way of making ourselves less lonely, or even a way of splitting our own personality into two so that we can be our own friend, and not feel like we're just talking to ourselves. Because if you think about it, even as you're having a ""conversation"" with this object, you're essentially playing both roles in the conversation, making up an entire personality to play off of your own.",0.4236536,0.54370254,0.032643896

"I‚Äôve driven all of the PPVs you‚Äôve mentioned, and short answer is this: **Toyota‚Äôs throttle mapping is such that small inputs in your accelerator already equates to more fuel/air being fed to the engine.**

To illustrate: if you have 20% pedal input on a Fortuner, you will likely be using 30% throttle, so it feels torquey/may hatak. If you have 20% pedal input on a Terra/MUX, you will likely be using ~20% throttle so it feels less responsive.

But if you actually drive both vehicles flat out, the Fortuner 2.4 far less power and is slower 0-100 than the MUX/Terra. To be data-based about it:

0-100 times:
1. Fortuner 2.4 (150 hp) - 12.5 seconds
2. Terra 2.5 (180 hp) - 11 seconds
3. Montero Sport 2.4 (180 hp) - 11.2 seconds
4. MUX 3.0 (190 hp) - 9.85 seconds
5. Everest 2.0 (210 hp) - 9.79 seconds
6. Fortuner 2.8 (200 hp) - 9.80 seconds

The 0-100 figures don‚Äôt automatically translate to real-world ‚Äúfeel‚Äù because if throttles are set up to be ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù then even little input feels powerful.

I also have a Fortuner 2.4, very responsive at city driving speeds but loses steam after 80 kph. Had it tuned and got an extra ~25 whp so now it feels responsive even at triple digit speeds. Can reach its ECU-limited top speed (185 kph) even with a full load of passengers. 0-100 is about ~1.5 seconds faster now.",0.10094411,0.8099479,0.089107946
"I have 2023 DC TRD OFF ROAD. The rear head rests impede your line of site when changing lanes. Fortunately you can flip them down to get a little better view. Unfortunately (for me) I bought leather seat covers to go over my sr5 interior. The head rest is part of the seat cover that you pull over the backrest. There is no slack in it to pull up and flip down without wrinkling up the backrest. I love the truck, but a few things piss me off. I used the bed fir the first time today, picked up 50lb of grasss seed, fertilizer. I then got 2 bales of straw to cover the seed. Well, I wanted to have the bales near the front of the cab for wind protection. I put the gate down, threw the bales in and the tried to step on any part of the bumper not being covered by the tailgate. I had to pull my knees up onto the gate to climb in (in 60 in good health).

"Only a few cars within the game have it, IRL any turbo car can have anti lag however over the time proper (note I said proper a lot of people talk a big game without actually having an anti lag system and that‚Äôs because-&gt;) anti lag systems destroy the turbo of whatever car has it, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs mainly used for race cars and not road cars, it would simply be too expensive to have them on road cars unless it wasn‚Äôt used very often which is generally the case for someone using it on a road car. Essentially what an anti lag system does is retard the ignition timing of the engine (this is meant for when your off throttle) allowing unburnt gas to escape into the exhaust manifold and then into the turbo, at the same time a valve lets extra air into the system such that it mixes with that unburnt gas, when this mix makes it to the hot turbo it explodes which spins the turbine eliminating lag and creating some truly magnificent sounds and flames, the first car to use anti lag in competition was the Toyota Celica GT4 (my favorite rally car of all time hence why I know all of this üòÖ).",0.5179187,0.44396937,0.038111944

"i would love to awd swap mine (it is possible) but i think id rather just throw a manual in mine so the drivetrain wont be entirely foreign to the chassis.

i could talk about what i want to do all day!

i currently have a 1mzfe, but the 2gr is a similarly sized engine, but it has more horsepower to the crank and greater displacement. i want the fse specifically because dual injection is better than gdi and i think the extra 20lbs and extra cash is worth greater reliability and horsepower, not to mention the 2gr is equipped with dual vvti. the 2gr also has extensive aftermarket support compared to the 1mz; it has things like staged camshafts, aftermarket interior parts, manifolds, cranks, valvetrains, fuel system upgrades... 

the flywheel side of the block can be ground down to fit an e153 manual transaxle (these can be converted to 6 speed, but the kits are rare) the ecu for the 2grfse is already jailbroken because of its use in sportier toyotas and lotuses, meaning power can be pushed to its limit.

awd is possible because the 2gr was used in the venza, and the awd variant had a u660f 6-speed automatic. 2wd venzas had the u660e automatic. the difference between these two is that the f has a transfer case. if i had extra time and money, i would totally go this route.

"I lived in a Toyota Matrix for 6 months and a Toyota Rav4 for 18 months

The main issue is condensation. I didn't install a fan, so every night regardless of rain I cracked all 4 windows significantly. Then I always have paper towels on hand. As soon as possible, I wipe the condensation with the paper towels and throw the wipes outside of the vehicle.

I wear calf socks. These are cheap on aliexpress, and very important. I also wear arm sleeves from Amazon, a muscle shirt/tank top, long sleeve shirts, toque etc. Stack warm clothing

I've become very cold resistant.

For water, I bought swell water bottles

For food storage, I bought milk-crate sized food warming bags (like, tiny versions of skip the dish bags) and then sat a milk crate in each one. 

I have one of those bags that is full of 18 thermoses, which contain protein isolate, various nuts, seeds, bee pollen and vegan supplements. So this is ""double insulated"" food.

The 2nd food warming bag is a split of fresh fruit and vegetables, which I buy frequently. I chow down on salad HARD so got to make it work

The 3rd food bag is oats, flax, some dried fruit, a butane burner, a pot. Everything I need to make warm Oatmeal. 

Those 3 bags line up one side of the car, beside me when I sleep.



I am very cozy and not ashamed of my situation. I stack ca$h, work 7 days a week, sometimes two shifts in one day. I have no patience for forking over like 50% of the fruits of my labour to a stranger (landlord). Absolutely not. SMD. I've always been bad at finding good rent situations. My friend finds golden opportunities. I find weird situations that make me feel bad.

BC Canada is beautiful, if you like being outside. Otherwise you're working two jobs just to go home anyways, might as well move away

Gym pass for shower.

My poops are regular and I almost never need to poo at night. Once I had diarrhea (tried to eat a whole tub of yogurt at once lol) I slept close to the gym

Would do it again. I love the fresh air. Sleeping by the river.

Too bad they shut down Spanish banks parking. 

Being there by the ocean literally helped me get over so much sadness and grief. There is nothing like sleeping and the fresh salty air is breezing over you (not that I can't work through my emotions elsewhere, but nature is true medicine.) Fuck government

The roof rack doesn't get used. I find it time consuming to go up there. So I don't use it EXCEPT to stuff my wet towels underneath. I don't like keeping the wet shower towel inside because it creates condensation

I'm a clean person and wouldn't be surprised if my hygiene is better than many people who live indoors",0.3677308,0.54335004,0.08891921

"This is super high. 

I recently took my truck to Toyota to ask them to TELL ME what was making this awful noise. They then ordered $3,000 of parts and brought me out a bill for almost $6,000. Labor was more than the parts. I got under the truck ( have a buddy who works there ) and it did in fact need everything they wanted to order, and needed it badly, but I straight up told the service manager no way a 3 hr job should cost that much in labor. He then proceeded to tell me they would give me a huge discount since I knew one of the workers really well. ‚ÄúHuge discount‚Äù meant 3%. I laughed. I told him to order the parts and I‚Äôd be there in the morning to pick them up. They then proceeded to tell me that there was no way I had a tool that they had and the one I had wouldn‚Äôt be big and strong enough to cut one thing out if it was stuck and I really needed to leave it with them. I told him to order the parts and then I‚Äôd do the work. He told me they really wanted to do it and could use my business. 

Went to pickup the parts the next morning. Had about 75% of what I needed, then had a bunch of crap they didn‚Äôt even tell me it needed and we had an argument in the middle of the service department in front of all their loyal customers and I told the service manager to his face he was full of crap and I wasn‚Äôt letting them screw me into paying for crap I didn‚Äôt need. 

Ended up getting mad and my buddy came over and wrote me up for all the parts I ordered, at a 25% discount and I walked out of there and told them I‚Äôd never be back. 

Basically they will act as nice and helpful as they can and try to literally scam you.

"Don't approach a subject thinking you know everything.  Even if you feel very proficient, there's always something you can learn.

If you're in school, take personal responsibility for your education.  Teachers do not get paid enough to give a crap about someone who doesn't want to learn.  Your own discipline is what is going to get you ahead in life, not some underpaid teacher who has a required syllabus. 

Learn to fix your own stuff. YouTube is full of how-to videos. The more you can do yourself, the more you can put in the bank.

A vehicle should get you from point a to point b without you having to push it. Flashy and expensive vehicles often come with flashy, expensive repairs. (I recommend a Toyota Corolla and learn to do the maintenance and repairs yourself. 

Buy a few books on investments and start investing.  Even if it's a little, it adds up. I recommend things you can touch. Property,  and metals.

Try to minimize debt. Starting out this is very difficult,  but if you can live within your means it's a hell of a lot less stress than having that looming debt blade hanging over your head.

Build your credit. A secured credit card is a good way to get started, but ultimately it's just a number so don't stress too much over it.

Treat everyone with respect.  It goes a long way and can end up coming back to help you in the end.

"I own a Canik TP9, Glock, 43, and Glock 48 (technically a 43x too because the 43 slide can be put on a 48 frame to make a 43x).

Comparing the TP9 to the 43X is like saying ‚ÄúI know you really want this Toyota Tacoma, but have you considered the Nissan Altima instead?‚Äù They are two completely different guns, completely different sizes, for a completely different use cases. That‚Äôs if he showed you a regular TP9. They do make a sub compact version which would be a much more fair comparison. I don‚Äôt have any experience with the Canik subcompact though.


Caniks are amazing guns. Severely underrated in my opinion. They have to be imported and it‚Äôs very hard to find mags but they are growing in popularity. They have one of the best out-of-the-box triggers you will ever use. My elite combat executive shoots like butter. I absolutely love it And could shoot it all day long. But I would never conceal carry my TP9 unless I were wearing huge clothing (im tall and thin and live in a hot climate). If you‚Äôre going to carry something of that size, you may as well start looking at the Glock 19.5. I‚Äôve been obsessively researching CCW Glocks for a month now, and I can tell you that all roads lead back to the 19.5. Every single time. I can elaborate on that if you want.


The Glock 43X kicks hard. It has a very short barrel, so you might struggle with accuracy past a certain range, follow up shots might be tough. My big thing with the 43X is that it has the same length grip as the Glock 19, and it is only .16 inches thinner. If your concern is a compact concealed carry that won‚Äôt print, the 43X is a bad idea. It‚Äôs an insanely popular gun for no real reason. The 48 is vastly superior to the 43X with no compromise. I will fight anyone to the death on that topic.
  
If you want ultra compact concealed carry, here are the best options in no particular order: shadow systems, CR 920. Sig 365. MP shield. Hellcat. Canik elite SC. Glock 43. There are others, but those are the main ones that I can remember off the top of my head. I would not consider the Glock 43. It barely hold any rounds, doesn‚Äôt have an MOS version, and it‚Äôs difficult to hold onto. Honorable mention to the Glock 26. It‚Äôs a thicc boy tho with the same short grip, I didn‚Äôt like it, but there are people who swear by it and it has its advantages.

I started my journey a month ago when I want to build a Gucci Glock 43 for carry. I bought one, shot it, hated it. Then I moved onto the 43X. But there is seriously no reason to choose to 43X over the 48. 43X holsters are 48 length anyway. There are a number of other significant advantages to the 48 with no trade off. The grip is what prints. 43X and 48 have the same length grip. Same with the Glock 19. Like I said, among other reasons, all roads lead back to the 19. The 48 is exactly the same size as a 19 it‚Äôs just thinner. Which I do like,  but it‚Äôs still a bigger gun to carry around.

For me, after desperately wanting my EDC Glock, I‚Äôve decided to go with the CR920P when it releases. It is the only gun, and I mean the only gun, that checks all of my boxes for an EDC concealed carry. Stippled grip. Thumb pad stippling. High capacity flush fit mags. A light rail. Footprint for an RMRCC. Black nitride coating. Slide serrations and a side window. Fluted barrel. Extremely small. Takes glock mags. Built in undercut to get a better grip.  The only thing it doesn‚Äôt have is iron sights forward of the red dot, which bothers me, but I‚Äôm willing to sacrifice that. 

A lot of my research was spent finding different companies to do this work on a Glock. Seriously, I could give you the rundown on every slide milling company in this country. But at the end of the day, it would‚Äôve taken 2 to 3 months for the build to finish, and it would have been well over $1000 for all the work. All that, just to have a Glock with stock internals. Or, pay like $800 and have all of that out of the box ready to go in a package with a significantly better, shooting experience and trigger.

So if you want some thing, fancy, get the CR 920. If you really really want to carry a Glock for its reliability, see if the 43 (not the X) or 26 works for you. If you don‚Äôt mind leaving Glock, the 365 is a great option for a simple gun that can be carried in your pocket. For me personally, I think the CR 920 is the best. It‚Äôs extremely small and packs ridiculous features.",0.052406043,0.6911739,0.25642008

"No problem, out of all those services i would rate the EFI as not important like last of all. Unless there is a problem with your fuel injectors. If it is i feel it is more of a warranty issue unless that has expired.

I use Liqui Moly Fuel System Cleaner 1 time a year when I service my car, being a 2012 it still has no problems with 81k miles. Regarding injectors or anything else really, (thank you Toyota for being the best car i have had) Which leads me to ask what is your Mileage?

I have seen cars with 14 year old brake fluid still being OK, but in need of change regardless.
I have also seen cars with 10 year old fluid NOT being OK. It varies. 5 years you should be fine and not overkilling. 

I sound like a broken record, because your car is in the recomend zone for these Services. But they did not say anything about the 40 000 mile ECVT transmission oil change? That is 5-6 years interval. Maybe next year or maybe they tell you the ""life time"" oil bullshit. 

No oil is life time oil,my friend almost ruined his differential on a BMW 2003 believing that crap, grinding noise, I begged him lets change it. 2 QT of oil and 2 plugs. No more noise and car still runs this was in 2018, and that sludge of black jello amounting to 20 fl Oz... so lacking alot of oil after 15 years.

If you check the links you can see ECVT oil change it is super simple no flushing no anything like that it is the same as changing differential fluid. I think in that video it is a RAV4 hybrid but do not fear even me in a 2012 Prius got the same setup, Toyota is not known to get rid of things that work ""keep it simple stupid"" is kinda what they do, this leads people thinking they are boring cars ect. If boring is reliable, im all inn.

And I ask again what mileage do you have on your Toyota?

Edit: 

https://youtu.be/TJhFAwFv-O0 if you ever get confused by 5k or 10k oil change just stick to 5k :) 

This car did everything the dealer recomend even your ""to do"" list every time something like that was presented. Engine started burning oil and the video is long due to him changing the engine block and yes i know it is not a Prius but the ""only"" thing that makes a Prius a Prius is the ECVT, Inverter and Hybrid battery, the engine is still a gas engine.

 Like most cars these days the piston rings are not thight or less spring force to reduce friction by then reducing the ressistance of the piston going up and down, to reduce emission at the cost of reliabilty. This is all well and good untill you introduce mileage and age. 10k is bear minimum in this case to keep service costs down from the dealers standpoint to lure people to buy the  car in the first place so they can then make money on future repairs/service. 

Do as you please with this info. I had a car burning 1 quart in 300 miles. A VW 2001 Golf, i had to replace the engine 2 times because the first replacement also burned oil like mad. 3rd engine latsted 45 000 miles before it got super bad again and I scrapped the car. Both of these engines was from a Junkyard, paid 600 dollars for 1st and 2nd was free due to the first being bad. Car was 12 years old at first engine change. Bought 2012, Scrapped in 2017.

"I took my niece to a classmate of hers and‚Ä¶ it was very sad and weird at the same time.

To put it in perspective, my niece had a Robin Hood birthday when she turned 8 and it was great. The whole class showed up, they had Nerf bow and arrows, and a friend dressed up as the sheriff of Nottingham who declared my niece as ‚Äúnumber 1 most wanted‚Äù. The food was delicious and I even brought over an awesome cake.

About a month later, a classmate had invited the whole class for her birthday. My niece didn‚Äôt want to go, but her parents made her and asked if I could take her.

My niece told me that this girl was annoying and a bully to everyone and said that no one would be there. I thought that this was just exaggerating, but NOPE!

The 2 of us got there and it was just the 2 of us, the girl and her parents. No one else in her class showed up.

I wanted to feel bad, but I had to agree that the girl was very rude and asked what car I drove. I said a Toyota truck and she lambasted me for not driving an eco friendly car and ‚Äúneeded to do better‚Äù. Her parents then went on a 10 minute lecture to me about the importance of electric cars and how I was contributing to pollution.

The party they set up was a ‚ÄúClimate Change‚Äù theme. There was no games planned or entertainers. They popped on a random YouTube documentary about the destruction of the planet and how people are bad. They only had the blandest of salads and a passable tofu casserole (I asked about beyond burgers and was told any kind of barbecue would set a bad example). The girl and her parents only wanted money or donations for a charity instead of presents. My niece and I were primarily looking at our phones, trying to figure out a good time to leave without hurting their feelings.

We stayed a couple of hours and her parents ended up canceling another animal rights documentary to end the birthday sooner. I think they could sense we wanted out.

Again, it's real and being pushed hard by the industry. The UK is throwing good money at it. 

The fact that many proposed applications for hydrogen don't make any sense isn't slowing the lobbying efforts to convince governments to subsidize them.

Robots aren't always the answer, because it depends on what you're doing and the scale you're doing it at. 

Don't forget that Tesla tried to fully automate production for the Model 3 and it nearly bankrupted the company. They effectively repeated GM's mistake in the 80s when they tried to automate a factory and it went so badly, they ripped out most of the robots and employed 10k people to output the same number of cars as a Ford factory with 5k people. For the money they spent, they could have bought Toyota and Honda

As far as replacing people with a general purpose Optimus bot or something, you'd have to purchase them up front and have people program, maintain and repair them, vs hiring a person and spreading out the cost over a long period of time.

Moreover, humans are much better at picking up individual items out of a bin, and can feel/see/respond to issues and sizing up a situation to make a judgement call if any issues come up.

"&gt;This report concludes that the looming hydrogen colonialism in the EU and Germany fails to deliver on global justice and energy democracy concerns as much as it fails to deliver on its key promise: to help tackle the climate crisis. Instead, there is a real risk that the hydrogen race will delay action to structurally decarbonise the economy: for example, increasing the energy efficiency of buildings (rather than heating homes inefficiently with hydrogen), transitioning to agroecological farming (rather than just greening synthetic fertilisers) and reducing traffic (instead of wasting energy on hydrogen-powered cars).

I am sure this report has some valid points. But apart from Toyota I don't think anyone is working on hydrogen powered cars anymore. Mercedes ended its development 3 years ago: https://electrek.co/2020/04/22/daimler-ends-hydrogen-car-development-because-its-too-costly/ 

Also energy efficiency in building is being improved a lot in Germany. This is the first time I actually heard about heating with hydrogen. Currently all development points to heat pumps and it is just a question of scaling production up as fast as possible. The share of gas heatings in new buildings is dropping fast: https://www.bdew.de/service/daten-und-grafiken/entwicklung-beheizungsstruktur-baugenehmigungen/

"&gt; In terms of performance, Rust beats Go. In terms of speed to market, Go beats Rust.

Ignoring the fact that the moment a webapp hits the database, both will run about as fast. Or as you stated, IO bottlenecks. 

If you come from PHP, and Go makes you push 100.000 request/s where as PHP did only 10k. Go is a clear winner. But if Rust makes you push 120.000 request/s, yes, Rust is faster but in the general scope of things, its not exactly the same effect.

And most performance between Go and Rust really comes down to design and optimizations done by the developers themselves. When i used Go templates, things are nice and speedy. Except the moment i learned that i can pre-load/pre-compile templates on compile/first run, those same templates run 50x faster. Go and Rust are really on the same ballpark for performance, with the main difference the easy of use. Where as PHP/Python etc are in a different ballpark.

I hate how idiotic the speed comparisons tend to be. Take a look at TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks, ... Rust wins ... except 98% of the people will not program code like that in such over optimized form. Stating this as somebody that summitted several project to the benchmarks. I turned PHP into something that competed with Go with Swoole and a few other systems like that.  They work but ... will people run it like that in production? I hope to god nobody ever does.

There is more to speed and i hate how every discussion about Rust, always turns into ""Rust is faster then X"" when its really irrelevant as they do not compete on the same markets. Its just programmers doing stupid things because they are blindsided by ""speed"". Its like somebody driving a Ferrari and going ""its sooo fast"" and yet, i rather have my more handy Toyota that can have more passengers, takes less fuel and is cheaper.

With that  said, Toyota/Lexus is the only brand I buy for myself.  It also DOES make a difference if your Toyota was made in Japan or North America.  A Japanese made Camry will have lower repair rate than one made in Kentucky.  As a former mechanic, I will die on this hill.

Hi there,

I'm currently leasing a 2022 Toyota Camry Hybrid, had it for about 9 months and am on a 3 year/30k mile lease. For a few months now, I've been getting hounded by the Toyota dealership wanting to talk to me about leasing or purchasing a different car.

My question is...why? I'm paying them monthly for a car I won't own that has now depreciated considerably. Seems like a win/win for them if I see my current lease through, so why do they seem so motivated to get me out of it? It makes me highly suspicious they they're trying to screw me over, but I also have had my eye on another car that will be less expensive to either lease or buy, so I'm considering having the conversation at least. But I want to go in with my head on a swivel.

Some thoughts: Do they want to sell it used because the car is in high demand and they can make a profit off of it now? Do the salespeople get commission for each new lease, so even if it doesn't benefit Toyota, it benefits them, which is why they are so motivated? Are they just hoping I want to lease a more expensive car? 

Also, don't I lose my initial down payment if I decide to start a new lease, or is it typical for this down payment to roll over into a new lease? 

The reason I decided to lease in the first place was because used cars with high mileage were selling for new car prices, and new cars were selling for 5-10k over MSRP. I was hoping that by the time my lease was over, the market would have stabilized and prices would be reasonable again, and in the meantime, I have no unexpected maintenance issues to worry about.  

If prices are still high, is there any advantage at all for me getting out of this lease at present, even into a lower monthly payment?

Any perspective you can offer would be appreciated.

"Hey. So, 'assault weapons bans' don't actually do anything. That's the rub. They're feel-good measures that prohibit certain weapons based on aesthetics, not capability. A wooden Mini-14 is functionally identical to an AR-15 except it looks brown and is therefore 'not an AW' according to every one of these laws.

Fact is: Any semi-automatic rifle is directly comparable, full stop. An M-1 Carbine from the 40s is every bit as capable in the situations that criminal shootings find themselves in, than an AK or AR.

AR-15s are not special in any way shape or form, they're just the 'toyota corolla' of rifles. Inexpensive because they're popular, firing the standard cartridge the US has used since the 1960s.

In reality, any firearm is dangerous and comparing specific types as somehow unusually deadly isn't actually advancing safety short of getting rid of all of them- And that cat's out of the bag both politically and practically. Most shootings are done with handguns for obvious reasons of concealability.

We have AWBs in many states, and they often make firearms MORE dangerous. For example, AWB-compliant rifles in New York and California are easier to drop, have less safe unloading and clearing procedures... while functionally identical rifles that shoot the same bullets at the same rates are allowed, because they're wood and look old timey.

&amp;#x200B;

"There were two noises. A long, sad, painful storyüôÉ

I knew what the first one was. My yaw rate sensor was making a high pitched feedback ‚ÄúEEEEEEE‚Äù noise. It was maddening because the pitch of the noise clashed with my tinnitus in the worst way possible. I had my center console pulled out and started poking around at it and it *zapped me a little.*

Then, I decided to look up recalls for my car and there was a [massive one](https://www.cars.com/research/toyota-avalon-2004/recalls/) for the SRS system where if not acknowledged, it could cause damage/shorts in the SRS. There were a few recorded incidents where people had their airbags deploy while they were driving. I looked at the service records (god bless the previous owner) and the recall was cleared on my VIN but there was only a record of the car going in to get the part, then a note at the bottom stating that the part wasn‚Äôt actually installed because it was on backorder. They cleared the recall on my VIN right after that with no mention of the part ever being installed. So naturally, I wanted Toyota to check the part and see if it got replaced or not, and then check the whole SRS for any issues or damage if it wasn‚Äôt because I would prefer to NOT have my airbags surprise go off while driving in DFW traffic. Which I think is pretty fucking reasonable considering the fact that my yaw rate sensor was real angry.

I cleaned up the connectors on the yaw rate sensor before taking it in and it wasn‚Äôt shocking me anymore but still ringing. *Fun fact: when people have hearing loss, the high pitches go away first.* None of the ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù Toyota dudes could hear the ringing AT ALL. I asked them to go get their newest, youngest guy. The kid said he heard the noise loud and clear. (REMINDER: EARPRO IS YOUR FRIEND!!!)

The second noise was also a high pitched ringing/whistling that sounded like it was coming from every direction in the front of the car‚Äôs interior. It got louder with speed. It was loud enough that coworkers who rode in my car asked me what it was. We all worked in a field troubleshooting DC electrical systems and all agreed that the noise was almost definitely related to something electrical. I honestly thought it was the factory amp/speakers going out so I completely unhooked it all and went for a drive. Still screaming. That‚Äôs the noise I asked Toyota to check out and figure out the source of. (Perhaps more SRS sensors freaking out?) I even had most of the interior gutted out and cleaned up for a different reason so it was a cakewalk to get to everything they would need to check.

I found it a week later. It ended up being WAY dumber than that. I was ashamed of myself when I figured it out. The clear protective coating on the chrome strip around the windshield was starting to peel off. When the wind hit it at just the right angle it made screaming whistle noises.

"The easiest way to get cheap insurance is to **buy a cheap car**. As *Bettye\_Wayne* already stated, the biggest mistake you can make is buying a fancy car, or even just a newish car. 

Expensive cars cost more money to insure. Instead, buy a 10-15 year old ""boring"" car. If you have to, bring it to a mechanic to get everything sorted out ^((new brakes, tires, rubber hoses, fluids changed, etc)). Ideally, you'll pay less than $6000 for this thing. At that price, you probably don't *need* Collision/Comp coverage (but that choice is up to you. If you can afford it, Collision coverage is always good to have). 

Also, luxury cars are usually cheaper to insure (because rich people don't get into as many accidents as poor people). I'm not telling you to go out and get a BMW, but a high-end car like a Toyota Sequoia may be cheaper to insure than a Toyota Matrix. Stay away from ""boyish"" cars like Honda Civic coupes and Hyundai Genesis. Young guys love to race (crash) those cars, so they're more expensive to insure. Keep it cheap, but classy.",0.46109694,0.46185836,0.07704465
"***Thanks for posting, /u/imbiggerboi! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of anything.***

Hi everyone, I'm currently confused about whether I should buy an older, used car or lease a newer one for a few years.

For context, I'm in my junior year of college in Los Angeles. I need a car for a summer internship this summer, and would prefer to have a car after my internship as well, at least while I'm in college.

Renting is out - not long term enough for the money, and with a loss damage waiver it's ridiculously expensive.

So  I'm left with buying or leasing. I have about $9000 saved up from tutoring during school, and my internship should net me an additional $10,000 after taxes. Of course, I'd rather not blow all of that on a car, so I'm looking for something under $10,000-$11,000 total. Either a pre-owned car for that amount, or a lease where all the payments come out to somewhere around that number.

Now, the pros and cons are tripping me up here. I've been looking into cars that are made to last - an old Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4 / Camry, Jeep Wrangler. I've found some decent stuff from private sellers around $6000-$8000 online, but even at the upper end of my price range they have high mileage and are from 2004-2008. Not to mention, I am inexperienced with cars and even with a mechanic's diagnosis, there are no guarantees or warranties. User car dealers are safer, but prices are marked up (I'm gonna check out some in person today).

My dad is telling me I definitely want something newer and more reliable with low mileage while I'm working. Buying such a car puts the total at around $14,000-$15,000 or so, at minimum. That's more than I would like to pay.

That's how I ended up at leasing. 3 years at around $260-300/mo works out to $9300-$10800 total, which I can live with. But then I don't get to actually own the car after paying all that, which sucks. Also, I'm graduating soon, so in 18 months I'll (probably) be working somewhere, at which point paying for a reliable car shouldn't be an issue. So 36 months may be an unnecessarily large term.

There's a chance I will want to go into some business of my own instead of working a standard job. So without knowing the future, picking a lease term is difficult.

I'm gonna go to some dealers today to look at supply of used cars and also some dealers leasing newer cars. I'm gonna ask about shorter lease terms too, 18-24 months. But before I go, I also wanted to hear from some professionals like you. What would you recommend I do? Should I rethink my price range, or change my thinking in any way? I would appreciate your advice.

"The E70 X5 is a great SUV, especially with the diesel engine.  It's awesome to drive with proper hydraulic steering, gets phenomenal 600+ mile range on the highway, and has massive torque.  The M57 engine itself is bulletproof, and it has a true sequential twin-turbo setup which makes for almost no turbo lag.  It's honestly almost perfect for a midsize SUV, and I massively prefer the diesel to the N55 gas I6 engine.

With that said, you need to be aware of some diesel-specific gotchas.  The US-spec E70 diesels have some chronic issues related to their emissions control systems.  The EGR cooler, SCR active tank, NOX sensors, and DPF systems are definitely weak points of the car.  BMW extended the emissions equipment warranty on these E70s to 10 years/120k miles, but unfortunately you're past that window on both age and mileage.  If one of these systems goes bad, you're looking at thousands to replace it.  The workaround lots of folks use is to delete the emissions systems, which removes the problem areas at the potential cost of emissions compliance (maybe not a big deal for you, depending on your state's emissions laws).  You also get much more power and better fuel economy once the offending systems are removed.  Google ""E70 ABC delete"" for all the info you'd ever want on this process.

Aside from emissions, at this mileage you definitely want to ensure that the transmission, differentials, and transfer case have been serviced.  Likely you'll want to do new fluids everywhere, and potentially mechatronics on the transmission.  This is also about the time that the M57 thermostat gives up the ghost, so that might be in your near future unless you can get decent service records on this car.  Other costly areas to be aware of are the glow plugs and controller and the sunroof.  Sunroof repairs for this model are ungodly expensive.  I'd also check out the suspension (shocks, controls arms, etc), as they may be due for a refresh at this age.

Remember also that this is a Bimmer, and it's not going to be as cheap to run as a Highlander.  If you are ok to spend more on parts and be proactive on maintenance, then you'll be rewarded with a way nicer SUV than the average Toyota.  If you don't want to spend much time, money, or thought on maintenance then I'd probably move on past this car.

"At issue with the comments on support for the cammers vehicle/driving, is the social dilemma. There's the law, that says a driver should attempt to avoid a collision, if they can do so safely. Then there's the social side that tells many of us, through many situations on the road, that drivers like the one in the blue vehicle often make dick moves with impunity, with the confidence that their victims will do the right thing, and always try to avoid. 

We're all human and flawed. No matter how mature, patient, or graceful each of us may be, there are times when we're just not going to put up with stupid shit, and as a result, we react with more stupid shit to cancel out the 1st stupid shit.

I'm older, more mature, have more grace, and experience. I try to be more patient with stupid people, realizing that I might still be alive today, based on the patience, maturity and grace of others, when I was busy being one of the stupid people.

In my 30's I bought my first house in a neighborhood near a 5-way intersection. At rush hour especially, people would cut through the neighborhood to avoid the traffic lights at that intersection. I had no problem with cutting through - my problem came with many of the people not even slowing down at the stop sign at the end of my street. The streets were in a 25mph speed limit residential area. After several near misses in the recent past, I was pretty fed up. One afternoon a lady in a Toyota Solara, top down, rolling fat dumb and happy, approached the intersection at the same time as me. There was another car about 1/2 block behind her, and nobody else approaching except for me. She was approaching the stop sign from my left, and I was approaching the intersection, preparing to turn right. She blew through the stop sign, and I just let it happen. We were each moving at about 20mph or a little less. I had a '90 F250 4x4 at the time. Conact was made at the front end of her passenger door, and we stopped when her driver side rear quarter panel hit the telephone pole next to the stop sign on the opposite corner of the intersection.

I have to say that her display of anger was mighty impressive. She just about jumped out of her car, over the door, to come yell at me. We both called the police. The dispatcher told me they would not be sending a unit when I said there were no injuries. She must have told them otherwise because a unit showed up a few minutes later. I told the cop that I simply assumed she would stop. My truck was a manual, and I had just downshifted to slow for the turn. 

Her car got towed, and I drove away with a scratch in the front bumper and a bent front license plate. I got a check from her insurance for replacement of the bumper.

- Didn‚Äôt like the interior as much. The seat felt less supportive and the rear seat felt more cramped to me. I think the reclining seats in the CR-V do a lot to make that space more enjoyable. 

- lack of availability was a big issue. Most RAV4 hybrids I found had a much more significant markup. 

- Driving and ride felt a little harsher compared to CRV. Although the rav will probably perform better off-road. 

- Lastly the concern over ‚ÄòCablegate‚Äô. The issue some RAV owners are experiencing with corrosion on the power cable connection from the battery to the drive unit.

"Here is my pitch:

The best Highlander you could own: a 2019 Limited or Platinum V6. Great practical functional design and built to last. Bulletproof.

2020 to 2022 Highlanders either in the XLE, Limited, or Platinum trim levels with the V6. Again, still a solid model but still prefer the 2019 model better.

2023 and beyond: It appears Toyota is retiring the tried and true V6 in the Highlanders. I don't care what anyone says, the 4 banger turbo is a big NO from me.  I'm sure it is a great engine but I question the engine's integrity longterm. And I'm not against 4 cylinder turbos; I have one in my other car and it is awesome but my other car is 2 to 3 thousand pounds lighter.

So if you are thinking about buying a 2023 and beyond Highlander, I would ONLY go with the Hybrid engine.  

Hybrids are growing on me and if there is any company I would trust for hybrids, it would be Toyota for sure.  BUT, in regards to buying a used hybrid, I would most likely pass (unless it was in tip top ""like-new"" condition).",0.070489496,0.39460665,0.5349038

Hello üëã im from Texas. I'm thinking about buying a car, but I'm not sure whether to buy new or used. I'm considering purchasing a Toyota SUV Highlander if possible, because my child participates in sports and we go on family vacations. I suppose it's something that will last forever. Not knowing what to ask when purchasing a car. I'm aware that my credit score is above 750. I'm thinking about leaving something down, but I'm not sure if that will help. I don't want to trade in my car because I intend to give it to my teen child. It's my first time purchasing a car on my own. I am not in debt, and my house and car are both paid off. I make around $60,000 per year. I'm not sure what else to add. Any recommendations? Thank you I‚Äôm advance

"&gt;	Fuck if I know.

TLDR: healthcare reform and a carrot.

From a gen Z gun owner(me):

Enstate a firearms license system, but open up the supressor and machine gun registry‚Äôs to anyone with a license. And remove import restrictions and 922r laws that require the destruction and rebuilding of firearm receivers and parts for ww2 historical and antiques being imported for collectors. 

Good Upstanding gun owners and collectors will go head over heals to be able to get non 922r molested historical firearms and machine guns. 

99% of American gun owners just want to collect cool guns, shoot at a local match the weekends and have weapon overmatch for if they or their friends/family are targeted by a criminal. (When you need a cop in the next 30 seconds they are only 5mins away! and in much of rual amercia they are 20mins to hours away.)

Give me the opportunity to buy machine guns and suppressors without an opaque ridiculous 12 month waiting period and i would gladly get licensed.

If you can‚Äôt compromise and realize that 99% of lawful gun owners arnt the problem and give them a carrot to work with then you will never get them to agree to anything. 

Also subsidized/free training and range time, if you want all gun owners to be trained then you need to remove the barriers to training.

No lawful gun owners want these mass shootings to keep happening, and quite frankly nobody likes that one unsafe guy at the range who should probably have their shit kicked in by the RSO (range safety officer) every week.

And make an incentive and give tools to   gun owners to be able police themselves. 

In ham radio for example if theres an unregistered tower generally making a nusence of themselves ‚Äúhams‚Äù will get to gether and do some fun radio triangulation to find them and tell them to shut up, and if they don‚Äôt listen they report there operating malpractices to the fcc with recordings of everthing and enforement occurs after the fcc gathers their own evidence and verifies that the accused has been in violation of good practices. 



One last thing is i would warn against going straight for the constitution change  or law banning route, we banned alcohol by constitutional amendment and and marijuana by law and look how people reacted to that and how effective the bans were. 


Like i said im a lawful gun owner, but i voted for burrine and then biden and in midterms for all democras except one republican who was one of the few republicans who voted against trump. 

Im open to conversation below about this, I don‚Äôt want these mass shootings to keep happening either. I think the biggest and most effective change of america‚Äôs culture will come from healthcare reform, encorging building livable community‚Äôs (im a member of r/fuckcars for example, and will be switching from a 3/4 ton diesel truck to a Toyota yaris soon and am actually pretty excited about it, I really loved my truck when i got it but over time it‚Äôs become a pain in the ass as a daily driver. I have to make 6 point turns where a smaller car could do a 360 and I don‚Äôt have space for a car and a truck).

"The Solterra, even per Subaru, is more of a stepping stone. It's a 50/50 effort for them and Toyota. While not impressive, it's plenty of an EV in itself, however for the price it should be better. For instance, I drive a Smart EQ, only 58miles max, and it covers my daily 90%. Not that it would work for everyone, but many could easily get away with it. The Solterra even has some cold weather elements worked in, like having a heat pump system on all models. The AWD was a huge focus of Subaru, and only existed because of Subaru, of which Toyota even admitted. 

It's also a stepping stone because they have never made an electric vehicle, and have made very few hybrids. Of which, the Crosstrek Hybrid was more or less a Prius drivetrain dropped into the regular Crosstrek.

I guarantee the only reason we haven't seen the 2.4 l is because they are already struggling to ramp up production of everything right now trying to drop a whole new engine with all the logistics and everything included.

"I read through some of your comments here, on Reddit, and on the YouTube too and I have to say that I am just going to ignore them because there is a very little effort from your part to support your claims while other posters took their time to provide logical reasoning why your are not correct. I watched your Kenmore/Panasonic vacuum video with particles emission and found it biased. It would be fair to do the testing after the vacuum is cleaned and with a proper new bag and with new filters. The condition of that vacuum would not be representative of the conditions of vacuum cleaner that people in this sub would keep theirs at.

This reminds me of cars talk: ""Buy Toyota because Ford is crap"". This does not add anything productive to the discussion.

Having said that, I after researching the vacuum manufacturing landscape I also was annoyed to find out that Panasonic sold their business to Cleva, which moved everything to China. To be fair, IBM also sold their business to Chinese Lenovo but some laptops models are still very descent but some not. 

In my opinion, Panasonic has always overachieved on design and quality of their products that differentiated them from other Asian manufacturers. I have plenty of things made by Panasonic at our house to see that. The reason they are not in business of producing many consumer goods anymore is probably that it is extremely difficult to design and manufacture products at such a low price that the markets demand now and still maintain the decent quality level. People seldom choose mid-market products these days: it is either total cheapest crap possible or the highest quality for the most money.

"Prices are nuts. If you can somehow put it off in hopes the market declines a bit, do so. However,  as an owner of a Corolla that has about 280K on it and it still runs and drives fine, I would look at Corolla or Camry.  Hopefully one with maintenance record. The one caveat is if you are looking at the older Toyota models, be wary of the 2.4 liter as they were one of the rare Toyota problem engines. Not all, but many.  Best of luck to you!

"There have been a bunch of crazy Omni builds, those are the 9 - 10 second builds, it's about a 2000lb car. There's some really quick Shadows and Daytonas that have been built too. A few 11 or 12 second minivans, mostly gen 1's and 2's. The Cloud Cars and especially LH platform haven't been pushed as far, the LH(Intrepid) is longitudinal FWD so they don't have a 5spd option. Chargers and Challengers are absurdly heavy, like 800-1000lbs heavier than my long wheelbase minivan, but there are a few of the V6s with Centrifugal Superchargers that fall somewhere between RTs and Scatpacks on the quarter mile. There are some supercharging and performance options from the Jeep Community as well, they used some of the V6s and a RWD derivative of the Stratus automatic transmission.

It comes down to cross compatibility between electronics, engines, transmissions, and other drivetrain components from a plethora of Chrysler/Plymouth/Dodge/Jeep/Mitsubishi vehicles over a 30-40 year span. There are a lot more bolt in parts and aftermarket support for Fords, GMs, Hondas, Toyota, etc. But, non V8 chryslers fall into perfectly into two performance builds: mild junkyard swaps making 200-300hp on stock components, and high end street/strip builds which require custom parts. If you're at the point of swapping in aftermarket rods, pistons, turbos, gears, and things of that nature, the platform is less relevant since things are going to need to be custom ordered and fabricated anyways.

A Stratus could muscle out about 300hp with either a mostly stock 3.5/4.0 V6, a mostly Stock 2.4L SRT4/PT GT, or a mostly stock Mitsubishi 4G6* engine. I actually missed that the Stratus had a Mitsubishi motor as the 4 cylinder option, I don't know a lot about Mitsu, but a quick Google search shows the 4 cylinder engine block family in the base Stratus tops out around 400hp from the factory in Lancer Evos. Alternatively, the 2.7L V6 on the higher trim Stratus also serves as the base engine for the Challenger/Charger, though the 3.5/4.0L are the same engine family, are absolutely drop in compatible, and superior. I'm sure a Wrangler/Grand Caravan 3.8L pushrod V6 could work too, less potential for modification but they belt out a healthy 240-250hp and torque from the right years and are perhaps the most reliable engine Chrysler ever designed.

Lots of interesting ways to go with it. It's unfortunate that we never got larger interest for modifying Chryslers, they could of been right up there with the rest of the major brands for tuning.",0.07532753,0.66593784,0.25873464

"&gt;'Trickle down economics' was disproven decades ago.

Trickle down economics isn't a theory, it is a left wing buzzword disparaging supply side economics, which has been a dominant popular theory among economists for decades, and still remains so.

&gt;That's why inequality is increasing at a rate unseen in human history. Because all the extra value created by workers is just being captured by the capitalists.  


Equality is higher than other areas of human history because we have more wealth than any other era in human history and because technology has increased the ability of one person to make themselves more valuable than another in the market.

In Marx's day, you could get rich by being rich and then having a factory, and maybe growing that factory. The amount you could grow is based on the factory's profitability. Let's look at the modern equivalent. Toyota is arguably the world's most successful car manufacturer. They produce gross margins in the 10-20% range, which is really good for a car manufacturer, and they have grown over decades to become an empire. Google has been around a fraction of the time, but has a business model that produces a gross margin in the 55-65% range.

Google has been around for 24 years, while Toyota has been around for 84 years. They are both the tops in their own industries, but Google is way more profitable on a percentage basis, so the compounding effect of that means Google has built an empire with approximately the same annual revenue as Toyota, and several times the profit, in a fraction of the time.

There is no 1800's equivalent to a dude in his dorm room creating an app that gets used by billions, and becoming one of the world's richest people. Hell, there isn't a 1950's equivalent of that. Today's ability for random joe to set up a Shopify store and sell products around the world the same day is just unprecedented, and so it the potential for income that comes with it.

&gt;That's why people this generation work more for less than people last generation, despite technology having made us so much more productive.

This is that grass is greener thing again.

Are there areas where the previous generation had advantages? Sure. Real estate pricing was a huge one. People like to talk about how affordable a home was in the 1950's, and sure, it was, but the US had less than a half of its current population it has now, and we had barely more than a third, all living on the same amount of land.

Did you know that the construction industry has actually gotten less efficient since the 1950's, despite technological advancement? [Here's a fascinating article about the issue.](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/05/opinion/economy-construction-productivity-mystery.html) The reason why, as the article discusses, is the regulatory burden that has piled up over time. Left wing regulatory regimes have actually added more regulatory burdens to the industry than technological development could make up for. So, yeah, we have a housing crisis. That's what happens.

Either way, go back and tell me whether you think most people would actually trade life in 2023 for life in 1950. We don't work more for less. Our poorest citizens have ready access to technology that people in the 50's could only dream of. Technology that was out of reach for the average individual back then, like TV's, microwaves or air conditioning, are readily affordable now. How much did smartphones cost in 1950? Or home computers? Or laser eye surgery? Or MRI scans? Or oral contraceptives? Or video game systems? Or GPS navigation? Or chickenpox vaccine?

We literally could not feed the world's population without the advances in farming techniques the last 70 years have brought. We could not be having the conversation we are currently having without advances in computers and the advent of the internet.

Saying this generation works more for less than people before ignores that we take for granted luxuries they could never dream of. 

Where were all those innovations made? From Warsaw Pact countries? Or, from the West?

And, it's not only the West who has benefitted from those advances. The Chinese economic miracle was accomplished with western manufacturing technology, western computer technology, western supply chain logistics methodology, western power systems, etc. Some of that IP was obtained legally, and some was illegally copied. And, they made their money experting to western economies, not through internal domestic market development.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The rest of what you said is just bullshit culture war nonsense 'these people are privileged'. Did you forget you're talking to a person with a disability who survives on the $13,300 a year that ODSP gives?

I did not forget that, which is why I figured you would be wary of political parties run by entitled elites who have no idea what it's like to live in your situation, and who drive up the cost of living for you through economic mismanagement.

I don't know if you were on ODSP when Harper was in power. When Trudeau took over, the average Canadian paid 39% of their monthly paycheck for their mortgage, and today it's 62%. Do you feel like the cost of groceries is more affordable nowadays? The cost of home heating and energy?

Are you one of the ones who was helped by the boom in real estate prices? Or one of the ones who was hurt by it? Did you benefit from the inflation in stock market prices driven by money printing policies?

This is what I don't understand. These policies don't help the less fortunate. Inflation always disproportionately helps those who have assets (since those assets raise in price) and disproportionately hurts those who own nothing (who get no benefit from price increases, but have to absorb cost increases.

We're not in year one of the most left wing government in Canada's history, we are in year 8 of it. Do you feel like you are better off than you were 8 years ago?

"Another issue with the Toyota manuals is that they absolutely require a GL-4 lubricant. Often, when the oil gets changed, they will get filled with a GL-5 or a GL-4/ GL-5 dual specification oil.... If any oil that meets a GL-5 specification is used in these transmissions, it will cause hard shifting! GL-5 specification oils are meant for high shear loads present in bevel gear style differentials. 

The reason for hard shifting in these transmissions when a GL-5 oil is used is because that for an oil to meet the GL-5 specification, it adds high pressure additives which do not work well with the old fashioned brass synchronizers that Toyota uses. 
Many manual transmissions made by other manufacturers use other more modern types of synchronizers which will work fine with GL-5 oils, but these transmissions absolutely need a straight GL-4 oil!

There are GL-4 only lubricants which are specifically designed for these transmissions made by Redline, Amsoil, and of course Toyota which will make these shift much better.",0.7281982,0.25619715,0.015604719

It lets the cruise control maintain being set and you can even change gears while it is set. It helps in emergency situations where you have less time to react.

[https://youtu.be/nLet3J2KAT0](https://youtu.be/nLet3J2KAT0)

 Subara's are just a little harder than other 4 cylinder cars because the spark plugs are accessed from the side so there's little room. But with the right tools and plan of attack that MrSubaru1387 shows you it's actually not bad... 

Also you might consider replacing your PCV valve since there is no interval change recommended from Subaru so normally I recommend 30K-50K. intervals since it's such a cheap part and easy to replace...

[https://youtu.be/FZYnn\_49rOE](https://youtu.be/FZYnn_49rOE)

&amp;#x200B;

Also in you plan to keep your car for a long time I would change your oil intervals to 5000 miles with full synthetic ... why? original when I got my 2014 Subaru Outback it was recommend 7500 miles on the manual... I did that for a while with Mobil1 one and then around 90K mile mileage it was burning about a quart.  So I research it... that 2013-2014 Outbacks are know for oil consumption issues and that Subaru of America in 2015 dropped the recommend mileage to 6000 miles... which I believe is recommended for your car....

Note what I learned recently: what's recommended by the manufacture  is the bare minimal  for maintenance  for keeping the car under warranty and the car manufacture does not care if the car last or not after the warranty or not..

Subaru suppose to fix the oil consumption issue, but I hear once in a while on reddit the even a 2018 Subaru has oil consumption issues because of worn out rings...  so my recommend go with the 5000 mile oil changes if you plan to keep the car for a long time.

Just get a car with a known history of reliability and get it inspected thoroughly to be sure it's in good condition, and then take good care of it. 

But if you're dead set on leasing it depends on the terms of the lease and what the estimated depreciation on the vehicle is to determine whether or not it's worth it.

BMWs, for example, are generally better to lease than to buy, if you must have one brand new.

"I think instead of pros and cons you need to break it down by ""needs"" and ""wants.""

Does the Highlander offer things that you need that the Prime does not have?

Does the Prime have things you want that the Highlander doesn't have?

IMO, the Prime is a vehicle you buy because you want it, not because you need it.  

The ability to drive a decent distance in EV mode and charge up at home is huge for me.  Not necessarily the financial aspect of it (you will never offset the higher cost of the Prime over a regular hybrid based on fuel costs) but the convenience of not having to go to a gas station twice a week makes it worth it.   I went 3 weeks without a trip to the gas station and when I finally went I filled up the tank with 4 gallons.  And I didn't really need to go, I just had to go to Costco for other things and figured as long as I was there I might as well fill up.  I could have gone another 2 or 3 weeks. 

The other aspect of the Prime that separates it from the pack is the 302hp.  This is only available when you're driving it in hybrid or Auto modes but it's the second fastest car Toyota makes after the Supra.  This was also something I wanted.",0.0874854,0.60897124,0.30354336

"I‚Äôm on the same boat. Both husband and I have never owned new cars and bought used and this was the first time we decided to buy a brand new car. The price for brand new vs a few years old model with 15k-60k miles was about $5-$8k difference so we decided to go with new.

We‚Äôre getting a Subaru at below MSRP (based on what Subaru‚Äôs website shows when you build the car) because I essentially went to 3-4 Subaru dealers around me to compare the price for the car we wanted. It was challenging to make a direct apples to apples comparisons at times because of different trims, add on packages, etc. but in the end one of the dealerships is selling us the car for ~$2.5k less than what other dealerships were willing to sell us the car for.

We were in the market for a hybrid and had the luxury of waiting if we had to, but the hybrid Toyotas and Kias we looked at didn‚Äôt fit what we were looking for so we settled for a Subaru. The waiting period for hybrids was anywhere from 9-14 months. I think the only reason we were able to get some $$ off MSRP was because it was the end of the month and we could feel the stress of the salesperson we are working with who kept talking about how quotas kept getting higher. We actually felt a lot more comfortable with another salesperson and dealership in general, but in the end decided to go with the dealership that saved us some money. Hope it won‚Äôt bite us down the line when we have to go back to this dealership‚Ä¶When I reached out to the first sales guy to see if they could match the deal we were getting, he pretty much said given then inventory and the car market, he couldn‚Äôt do anything.

Story aside, we decided to go with new as well even if it‚Äôs costing us 20-30% more because this is a car we want for our family use, will maintain really well, and drive it for the next 10-20 years.

Lots of the used lots around me typically have 20-10 cars on site that are all older (Say 2005-2015) with 70-150k miles. 

They are in OK shape, but being in the north east, a lot of things are inevitable. 

I always wonder what kind of profit these guys are pulling on a given car.

Older Toyota Matrix listed for $9k? How much do they have in the car... $6k or $8.5k?

Just wondering if there's a ballpark for this rough estimate. Are these guys typically banking that they'll get people who need to finance in order to turn a profit? Or do they also rely on people buying extended warranties?

Also make sure you know what your base finance numbers look like ahead of time, or know how to calculate them quickly if you don't know your finance terms yet.

1. Chrysler  - lots of early rebuilds 
2. Ford &amp; Chevy -- about the same quality between the two.
3. Honda/ Toyota with Toyota eking out a narrow win

This was dealing with cars made before the US bailed out the American auto companies. Now they can't operate at the old low price point anymore (emissions standards), so I suspect their reliability has gone up, but I'd still expect the same general trend.

"Well, that is unfortunate you think that way. Taxing people without there being alternatives for people to move to to avoid the tax does not work, we still need to heat homes and lack robust public transit options for instance. Additionally, the cost to produce and move goods we absolutely need (ie we need to eat!) rises due to carbon taxes.

I also prefer positive reinforcement/incentive as an approach (make a better choice, get rewarded) rather than punishment (taxing) to change behaviour. Give me options that have a clear ROI, I don't mind say spending more to insulate my house better because in the long run this saves me money AND helps the environment (I have R60 in my attic and the most efficient 98% furnace, both above code but keeps my gas bill lower). Or I don't mind buying a more fuel efficient vehicle (I am considering a PHEV for my next vehicle - Rav4 Prime) since it costs less to operate (or would, if I could actually buy one, but there isn't enough availability, given Toyota is here, why not help them increase production of hybrid/plug in hybrid vehicles?).

Further, investment in technologies that continue to make ""green"" (or hell, even just green-er, we don't have to go to end state from the beginning, any reduction is better than none) alternatives more viable/affordable is always a good idea. Carbon capture could work out long term, I've found what Porsche is doing with fuel to be quite interesting. Technology can mature and I have more hope in tech than I do in tax.

The carbon tax does nothing and is the stupid beuracratic approach to trying to improve the environment. It's unfortunate you've bought into that nonsense that is costing us dearly without improving a damn thing (regardless of how it's implemented).",0.5144456,0.41234824,0.073206164
"Rotella T6 is a great oil that has API-SN rating for gas engines as well as diesel CK-4. Relative to other common oils available in 2023, it has higher levels of zinc.

"Nah, I see ""doxxing"" as the deliberate sharing of someone's personal information that couldn't otherwise be easily found out. Like, ""I hate Tucker Carlson, we should go egg his house!

CC became a thing in the mid-2010s (though ""cancelling"" someone was a joke in the 90s!), but it wasn't mean or spiteful until people began to use it more widely on social media.

You could even say that the Civil Rights boycotts in the 50s nd 60s were COC! 

When used correctly, COC can be a very powerful tool to enact change. But people take it too far, and use it to punish people or companies for any perceived slight or offense.

Cancel Culture's effect on brands and businesses have become ""[mob rule,](https://digiday.com/marketing/cancel-culture/)"" where even good intentions can get cancelled if enough people on the internet complain about it. Mainstream internet activism is a lot of calling out and blaming and shaming. They aren't enacting the changes they want, and they remain mad and sad. CC and COC has become a toxic practice where people attempt to expunge anyone with whom they do not perfectly agree, rather than remain focused on those who profit from discrimination and injustice. It's horizontal; not done to justifiably criticize people who are dangerous, but to score brownie points against people who mean no harm.

"I think we're talking about two different things here. One is the video and the other is the overall technology compared to the past. For the video, I can't watch that and say it's a good thing. Until we get to a point where cars are truly driverless, you're not going to convince me any vehicle moving along with someone inside who is unresponsive is good, no matter the car. Teslas aren't fully self driving, regardless of what's been advertised for it, and to me the video shows it's still not ready. The standard should be for the vehicle to recognize the driver is no longer able to take control if need be and come to a stop safely. Period. It should not continue on its journey at all, because the driver isn't there to step in if needed, making it a danger to everyone else around it, and the driver themselves may need help. I'm pretty sure even the current ""full self driving"" test states the driver needs to be ready to take over from the system if needed. 

To the second part of this, which is the tech compared to the past, yeah, the POTENTIAL is definitely there but I have differing thoughts on how this compares to a decade ago. Is this better than people passing out and crashing? Probably, I lost a family member that way. Would this tech had existed in 2000, then he might still be alive. But not if the car just kept driving him, because he most likely had a heart attack behind the wheel. He needed medical assistance, not just to get home. Obviously the vehicle not veering off into other cars or a wall is good, but it seems like a failure of the design because it clearly should not be able to do that, not yet, it should just come to a safe stop. So I sort of agree this is better than ten years ago, depending on the circumstances. Like going 60 and passing out, yeah you're going to have a bad wreck and maybe hurt someone else too. Then what's happening in the video is better. Going slow and passing out and having a fender bender or just veering off the road into a ditch might be better if the driver is having a heart attack since damage is minimal, no one else is hurt and the driver can get medical attention. Either way, this car should be able to stop when it detected someone passed out. And this isn't the first video I've seen like this, or where people defeat the safety system and get in the back seat. None of that should be possible. 

Last note, Tesla is supposed to have some of the most advanced tech out there. I wouldn't compare it to a Toyota or a Honda or a Kia. I don't particularly like Tesla for a lot of reasons that have to do with fit and finish, no offense, but if you're going to compare it you need to look at similar cars, otherwise it's an apples to oranges comparison. The Toyota lane keeping isn't meant to be self driving. Really neither is the Volvo until the next gen electric cars but I think it does a pretty good job and let's me turn around to check on kids or grab something quickly and not worry too much. It takes tight turns well, but it's never meant for me to just ignore the road entirely. Probably ford or gm have the closest autonomous systems for now. Volvo and Polestar have LiDAR coming in the 2024 EX90 and Polestar 3 and a promise of level 3, meaning eyes off hands off driving.

Wenger is the manager who made the Premier League, The Premier League, which btw is not my words, but Pep's own, who you praise so much.  

 He's responsible for making it a global and bringing excitement to it in the first place with a unique style of football, man management, diet and so on. The Premier League was nothing before his arrival. He made the Midfield an extremely important part of the game. 




Mourinho on the otherhand, was responsible for bringing innovations to the defense, the most focal one being the Defensive Midfielder.




&gt;Ferguson experienced it first hand in the CL final of 2009, two years later the result was the same in another CL final.


Ferguson did not 'experience' new football in the UCL finals. He experienced what happens when you bring an aging/average team, especially that Midfield against the Midfield of Xavi-Iniesta-Busquets and the best team in history.


The same happened in 2011, but worse because his aging/average players were even older and now facing off against the prime of Barcelona. It's a miracle that 2011 Man Utd team even reached the finals with that team. It had been screaming a proper rebuild. 


And that's why Alex Ferguson gets praise in the first place, because he made 'average' players play world class football. Park Ji Sung, Tom Cleverly, Phil Jones, Fletcher and so on, all 'average' players, but were regulars under Ferguson and played like beasts.   


Pep and Klopp can run a Ferrari like a Ferrari should be run. But Alex Ferguson can run a Toyota like a Ferrari.

I do agree that it cannot go on like this, since it‚Äôs a political and societal downward spiral. But I think Sam is a bit too idealistic here. 

I think measures like this have to go in line with a program of on-shoring production and de-privatization of certain sectors, so the economy is not fully exposed to the blackmailing of global corporations and certain basic needs are always met. Plus, a stronger welfare state like you have it in certain European countries.

"&gt;they're pivoting.

TLDR; Toyota is going the hydrogen route, no? Also, BEV is the clear winner, but I still find hydrogen tech interesting. Hyperion, for example. 

Maybe I'm wrong, but aren't Toyota massively moving towards hydrogen technology? 

I see two major changes in technology moving forward, not just for Toyota but for the world.

1) BEV is the current leader in technology, but batteries face a few obstacles as it stands: charging speeds, temperature issues causing range anxiety or unforeseen range issues where cars display a range that it doesn't have due to terrain, driving habits, adding a lot of weight to vehicles, and like I said, temperature. As it stands, BEV can be temperamental in this arena. When batteries become more efficient then we'll likely see these issues subside for the most part. BEVs are the ""path of least resistance/logical bet"" option. It has tremendous odds of being an even bigger hit in the future. 

2) Hydrogen alongside of BEV, just like diesel is alongside gas. Hydrogen has a metric shit ton of drawbacks as it stands that make it the underdog and the ""crap"" horse to bet on. Storage issues, cost to make, cost to fill up, etc. Assuming we create all green hydrogen then there are still issues with the system. The only potential saving graces for the tech falls within two realities: 

2. A)  Creating hydrogen at the pump with green methods (assuming we can store enough energy through green methods to do this). So the pump would be filled with water and then it would create hydrogen to fill the cars up. And this still doesn't solve potential storage issues once in the car. And there is still the massive cost to make the pumps.

2. B) Having the car convert water into hydrogen itself, using the battery to fill in gaps in the hydrogen creation process. Water at the end of the process can be expended through the tailpipe like current FCEV, or you could ""close"" the system by putting the water expended st the end of the process back into the water/""fuel"" tank.",0.017358685,0.43971393,0.5429274

"I love the Rav4. I come from a Toyota family, so there's definitely some bias when I talk reliability and safety.

I had a 2017 Rav4 but hit a deer in fall 2020 when the car was just shy of 4 years old. The tow truck driver was like hey in normal times, they'd repair it, but since the parts factories are shut down with covid, it'll be too expensive for replacement parts and the scrap value will be too high. Sure enough, geico totaled it. Wasn't a bad hit or anything, but I walked away without a bruise. It had 85k miles on it and I got back ~66% of what I originally paid for it because toyotas hold their value. Definitely helped that the used car market was hot at the time, but still.

I liked the Rav4 so much, I turned around and bought a used 2019 as a replacement. It's one of the bigger cars in its class which is ideal for me. Plus, the new body on the 19 vs the 17 gives even more space for passengers.

I haven't had any issues with parts wearing out before their time.

Current one had 18k miles when I bought it, and now, 2.5 years later, it's around 45k. No major maintenance on it yet and it's still driving well.

"&gt;I definitely question why anyone would think a RAM """"truck"""" necessary

Happy to help you out.

The trend in large SUVs traditionally used to tow large caravans etc is they are getting heavier with factory features and and safety equipment while their maximum allowed vehicle and tow weights have not changed, which leaves them with pitifully small legal cargo capacities. What that means for a $130K+ 300 series Landcruiser is that if you want to tow the max weight of 3500Kg, you are left with only 260Kg for passengers, luggage and any accessories like a bull bar / roof rack etc. Expensive GVM upgrades are available but do not increase the total allowed weight (GCM) so towing capacity is still affected. It is estimated there are thousands of tow vehicle / Caravan combinations on our roads that are overweight and therefore unsafe.

However a tradie, horse owner, caravanner etc can buy an unmodified RAM 1500 dual cab or similar off the floor with twice the legal cargo capacity and an extra 1000Kg of towing capacity for less less than a modified Toyota Landcruiser and without being on a wait list for months.",0.42054746,0.53758234,0.0418702

"I prefer A9, reasons (mind they are personal, so other can differ on this!):

1. The manual control system in A8 and A9 doesn't work for me. It requires a good amount of skill which I never mastered (don't bother me about trying manual - I  tried!). In A8 I actually managed to get over 100 cars and get to the last season in Career, but don't ask me how many times I wrecked (and MP is out of the question without good skills) ü§£. In A9 there's this magical thing call TouchDrive. I you're not competitive like me this mode gives enough enjoyment. A8 doesn't have this feature, so this is the main reason I play A9 hours a day and A8 at max 30 mins.
2. A9 has a lot ""to do"". All kinds of events, etc. etc. which keeps me busy. In A8 this is more focused on MP only and less on singleplayer events, which I like more.
3. Despite all it's downsides, I actually prefer the blueprints system in A9. It gives me much more focus on saving for cars.
4. The upgrade system in A9 is more straightforward, especially after the last changes GL done in A8. It's a mess and extremely expensive to upgrade even the lowest cars.
5. In terms of P2W I suspect A9 would ""win"", many offers are outrageous. But GL sure tried to make A8 more P2W over the years.
6. A8 is 5 years older and will sooner or later reach end of life, GL still keeps it alive - probably because there's still a decent player base and income.

If GL would implement TD in A8, I might play it more. But I think retrofitting that is quite a job and might need a complete rework so that will never happen.

Things I miss from A8 in A9:

* Would like to see some cars from A8 in A9, just to name a few: Peugeot RCZ, Ford Focus RS &amp; Mustang GT, Datsun 280Z, VW Beetle, Renault Clio R.S, DS3 Racing, Subaru Impreza WRX STI , Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo, Ferrari 308 GTS &amp; Testarossa &amp; 488 Pista, Toyota Supra (some are not available in A8 anymore, here's a full list: [https://asphalt.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle\_list\_(Asphalt\_8)](https://asphalt.fandom.com/wiki/Vehicle_list_(Asphalt_8)) )

"I own and love Mazdas. But I'm also not moved by the ""premium"" marketing. And here's why: Mazda's dealer experience is so very far from what ""luxury"" brands offer. Like not even close. Most Mazdas are still being sold to people who worry about how much of a monthly payment they can actually afford.  Those buyers are not cross-shopping Lexus or Audi. They're cross-shopping Kia and Nissan. 

The other thing to note, if you're familiar with Audis and Lexuses, is that Mazda makes obvious compromises to provide ""premium"" interiors and aesthetics. OEM tires, batteries, and some materials (cough paint cough) are definitely inferior to the best quality levels for such things. So does every other economy brand. Mazda beats most luxury brands on mechanical reliability of the drivetrain, but they shave off a few dollars here and a few dollars there in ways that get obvious once you've owned a current generation Mazda for a few years, as I have. 

These labels are mostly marketing BS anyway. But I for one don't feel any desire to own or signal ""premium"" anyway. I want reliable, efficient, and fun to drive, the combination Mazda mostly has delivered for years now.  I also don't want to pay Lexus or Audi prices, even though I'm well off enough that I could afford more expensive cars easily -- hey, one secret of being well off is being fucking CHEAP.  The two Mazdas in my driveway have 380k miles between them. And I keep them maintained to spec mostly myself. 

And I don't believe Mazda has the brand history or equity to ask those prices in the US from buyers of other luxury brands.  But I damn sure don't want to pay those prices when the dealer experience feels fairly close to Hyundai or Nissan scamminess.

I keep thinking Mazda North America knows that the reputation of its dealer network does not meet the ""premium"" standard. But I'm not sure they've addressed it. At the end of the day the average Mazda buyer is more likely to be worried about how much of a monthly payment they can afford, compared to the average Audi buyer. Mazda can't lose that business unless they steal wealthier customers from Audi and BMW and Lexus. And for that, you need snob appeal, and it's hard to see that happening.

The other way Mazda is not competing with luxury marques is by failing to get their act together with BEV and hybrid offerings. Most of the luxury brands are quickly moving to hybrid and BEV only, except for high performance cars that Mazda will not compete with anyway.

Don't get me wrong. I'm a longtime Mazda buff (back to the 80s) and own two right now. But I've always thought of Mazda's brand identity as ""smart"" rather than ""prestigious"" -- a lot of car for not a lot of money, more fun to drive than competitors at any segment level, reliable enough (if not quite Toyota reliable). And quirky enough to stand out as a conscious choice. The thing I love most about them is the way they feel Japanese aesthetically and mechanically, more so than other Japanese cars sold in the US for me (as I love all things Japanese TBH).  I'll be sad when and if they become indistinguishable from other brands in the segment, even if they segment is a notch higher.

"Look for used or you can buy high quality ""fake"" or ""tajaari"" for half the price. A lot of people don't realise that many times those ""fake"" or ""tajaari"" parts, even though that's the street name, are in fact OEM supplier and are up to exact specification sometimes even better then the ""original"" the only reason for their lower price is that they don't have the company name stamped on it.

Example:

Denso, manufacturers and supplies to Toyota. Toyota puts their name on it and sell its for 1800AED.
The same exact part which has just written ""Denso"" only on it but not Toyota goes for 800AED. They are both manufactured by Denso and are made in Japan.

In your case, a fuel pump, there are few options, look for high quality Made in Japan ""tejaari"" or ask your mechanic if he can do a few little mods and install AEM fuel pump which will last your twice as the original with half the price.

Edit: A Google search suggests this fuel pump is for Suzuki motorcycle, most likely GSXR750, Suzuki sells complete fuel assembly and does not sell pump separately.

Amazon 15100-37H01 this part number and you'll find a fuel pump from ""HFP/Quantum"" looks like 350AED including delivery with excellent reviews.",0.31639194,0.62138206,0.06222597

"- 2nd Paragraph

Nope, that's not the real reason which was debunked by Toyota themselves.

It's all due to the license fees and agreements between EA and Toyota. Same case for other car brands or other elements under license.

If it was really the case, Toyota cars wouldn't be featured in NFS 2015, Forza Horizon,Initial D, Wangan Midnight or any other racing games which includes street racing. 

They wouldn't be also appearing in any Fast and Furious movies.

To simplify, it's all about money. 

If the publishers can afford the license of the car brands involved and find an agreement, they will appear in the games in question.

That mainly explains why Forza and Gran Turismo games have so many cars since they can afford the licenses and they're owned by Microsoft and Sony in the 1st place.


Which means what you've said in your 1st point is only the real answer.",0.3519907,0.6124044,0.03560493

For context if it matters this is in Australia. 

My boyfriend (M20) and I (M20) were driving back to my place to hang out after a mate‚Äôs birthday gathering. We also had another mate - let‚Äôs call him J (M20) - join us who was driving in his own car behind us with another friend in the passenger. 

As I am a leaner driver (L plates), my boyfriend who is a full license was accompanying me to help me get my hours up. When we arrived near my location, I was instructed to slow down a little so that we could find a place to park. There was no sudden stop, it was a slow gradual slowing down of the vehicle until I believed I got to a point where I could start reversing into a spot. We stopped for about a full second until we were hit really hard from the back by J. 

Obviously panicked we all found a place to stop so made sure that everyone was safe and okay. No one screamed or yelled, we just wanted to make sure no one was hurt. 

As we did not believe that this was our fault, which was backed up by the passenger in J‚Äôs car who saw him get too close to our car, we asked him for his insurance details however he wasn‚Äôt sure we had it until we found out in the morning that he doesn‚Äôt have third party property damage. 

Again during this encounter, no one was angry, there was no yelling or anything involved, we both just did the right thing which mean exchanging license information and so on, however I just can‚Äôt fathom the fact that he hasn‚Äôt got any property insurance. J was panicked, but my boyfriend was reassuring him that it would be ok and the most important thing is everyone is safe. 

We went into a smash repair today and was basically quoted that the vehicle would be really expensive to cover, upwards to 10k to fix. My car isn‚Äôt a fancy BMW, it‚Äôs a second hand Toyota Corolla from 2008 and there is some sentimental value as it‚Äôs a car my mum and I saved up for and got when we were really struggling. 

J is adamant that it‚Äôs both of our fault and is refusing to take responsibility. I‚Äôm trying to be as accomodating as I can and trying to see if we can both make it work and compromise but we‚Äôre sure that it‚Äôs not our fault. Because J doesn‚Äôt have insurance I feel bad that he has to cover it out of pocket, but I don‚Äôt see other options. Basically the mechanic and people have advised me that if they don‚Äôt offer to pay, then I‚Äôd have to pursue the police, however not too sure how to feel about it. 

Basically, AMITA for trying to get my mate to pay for the damage to my car, or if I pursue the police if he declines?

"Anti-monopoly laws, Toyota tried that in the 2000s across Quebec, it was pretty good, people liked not having to haggle.  The only thing that one could haggle on was on the value of the trade-in.  The dealers could sell the trade-in to another dealer for the same price they gave the customer with paper proof (ie dealer **a** offered 1000$ for trade-in and dealer **b** offered 2000 for the same trade-in, dealer **a** could sell the trade-in to dealer **b** for 2000$), it was written in the ""rules"" we gave every customer they what were their rights and whatnot...

It worked for about 7 years, after that, the anti-monopoly consumer protection decided it was not fair game.  Toyota dropped it and dealers had to actively inform the customers it was not fixed price anymore.  

It was honestly the most fun time to have a Toyota dealership as it created strong bonds between dealerships, there was no animosity at all, it was pretty rare we would ship trade-in unless there was something obviously wrong.

All it took was a couple of customers saying they were not happy about not being able to haggle anymore, Toyota had given us bad script, we should have never said it was not negotiable ""as per Toyota""... Dealers should have said the don't negotiate and never implicate Toyota... 

Anyway, long story short, that is why there is no ""no haggle"" dealership.  Also in Quebec, it is against the law to sell the car over MSRP, that does not prevent a dealership to add bogus fees though but those can be fought if the customer perceive it is a way to raise MSRP, ie : normal car added fees : $1000, special edition added fees: $10,000, it would be a clear cut case where the dealer is increasing MSRP with bogus fees...  

Another way dealers did screw customers was essentially selling the new car as used car, (circumventing the MSRP law) they did that during the pandemic when stock we very low.  Again, if it can be proven, the dealership can be in serious trouble.",0.0917702,0.577829,0.33040082

"This might not be in your wheelhouse, but have you thought about buying a cheap older economy car instead? If you are able to get a car like an early 2000s Honda, Toyota etc for a few thousand dollars and have a clean driving record, you would be able to pay off that car in a reasonable time frame. 

If you assume you are going to pay $7 a day in GO fare from Bramalea to Toronto that works out to $140 a month. Using a 2001-2005 Corolla as a base guide of 10.7km per 100km of driving, you'd be using about 8.8L of fuel to go there and back. At $1.40/L that works out to $12.32 a day in fuel or $308 a month. 

So to go to work with a $70 a month insurance cost and $50 a month in misc car costs you're looking at $140 + 308 + 70 + 50 = $568 a month in travel costs to work all in or 

Now you might be thinking, that's nuts! However if you can get 3 other people to hop in the car with you and pay you $15 a head a day to drive them to and from Toronto things look better. 

If you use $15 as a base price you'd collect $900 a month from them. Which works out to $10,800 a year. With your yearly costs being $6816. That means if you got a 2001-2005 Corolla for $2000 you would have your transportation costs for the whole year paid off, including the cost of the car, in 9.8 months. After the car is paid off you will cover the $6816 costs in 7.5 months and end up with a profit of $3984 in the following 12 months. 

Now sure there are going to be a bunch of variables like some months you might have $200 in repairs or maintenance needed for the car and other months you might have none. Some months you might take 2 people for 10 of those days or something like that, but either way you're looking at paying off all travel costs in the first year and making around $2000 - $3000 a year minimum after that first year is over for just driving to work everyday.",0.05935307,0.72636133,0.21428563

"Warranty on the hybrid battery is 10 years/150,000 miles. Toyota wouldn't do that unless they expect it to last a lot longer than that.

Prius Taxis routinely get 300k miles on the hybrid battery because it is good for the battery to stay balance through active usage. So, Your 30k+ per year is a good use case for a hybrid.

It's people who do 10k or less per year who should worry about premature hybrid battery failure.

Also, I disagree with the post below. I got 7 years + on a Prius 12v battery and am now past 4 years on my Rav4 hybrid with no problem

"My goodness. Hot take orgy in here. 

Honda and Toyota will be fine. This is not a Blackberry situation for a few reasons, but the number 1 reason is a very simple one: they still have A LOT of time to pivot. And, they're pivoting.

And both are leaders in categories that will define the evolution of powerplants for some time: Toyota with its PHEVs and fuel cell tech, and Honda as the world leader in small or auxiliary powerplants (industrial equipment, generators, etc.)

But, and this is not a great thing but it is a true thing, there will still be a huge market for ICEs in 15 years, globally. The two most respected ICE manufacturers, separately committing now to an EV future we'll within that horizon, are not sweating. There may even be a bottom line benefit to them moving slowly.

I honestly expect great things from both companies in the EV space because they have earned that through years of not necessarily being there first, but regularly being better once they get thege, and because I think both are especially poised to do some amazing things with PHEVs in the nearer term (PHEVs have a massive, unrealized ceiling that is often underappreciated in this subreddit). Honda may not go that route, though, instead bridging with GM platforms; which has been a common move in the car industry for literally decades.

I very much look forward to a +-200 mile range, light-ish, fast charging AWD (or not, considering the magic they achieve with FWD cars) civic-type that is fun to drive but also practical, with heat pumps for battery thermals and cabin air conditioning - and literally nothing else flashy about it.

I can‚Äôt speak for your vehicle (since I haven‚Äôt tried its auto pilot) but compared to Toyota and some of the other auto manufacturers, Tesla auto pilot / ‚Äúfull self driving‚Äù is substantially better. Toyota‚Äôs lane keep is pretty garbage when lines disappear or have gaps and it doesn‚Äôt support making turns or changing lanes. In the absence of lanes it does fairly well at figuring out where the assumed lanes are. So a 2023 Toyota vs a 2023 Tesla is no comparison in the event someone passes out while on auto pilot/lane keep. That‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs not perfect, but Tesla‚Äôs full self driving has a chance at driving someone home while passed out while Toyota and other vehicles (assuming yours can‚Äôt exit a highway and navigate city streets and turns) would have for sure resulted in a severe crash the second the road didn‚Äôt have lines or required them to exit the highway.",0.6866607,0.28634635,0.026992928

- if you liked your ford, I would look at Ford Escape‚Äôs as they‚Äôre decently reliable and lower cost. 

- stay away from Chevy, GMC, Luxury brands unless it‚Äôs Lexus or Acura. Stay away from Nissan and Jeep as well. They will look shiny and be in budget but they will all be ticking time bombs. 

- you might fare well with Kia / Hyundai. Try to find a regularly dealer serviced 1 owner, accident free. 

- Mitsubishi Outlander Sport‚Äôs are alright as well as Toyota and Honda but you‚Äôre going to struggle in this price range. If you‚Äôre okay with older, Lexus RX 350‚Äôs are amazing! 2007+.

"Yes, you could say that the creation of patterns and structures through the interaction of various fields and forces is a fundamental characteristic of the universe. From the formation of galaxies and stars to the behavior of matter on a microscopic level, the universe is constantly undergoing change and transformation driven by these interactions.

In some cases, the patterns that emerge can be quite beautiful and intricate, such as the Chladni figures mentioned earlier. In other cases, the patterns may seem chaotic or random, but are still the result of underlying processes and interactions.

It's worth noting that while many patterns and structures in the universe arise through natural processes, others are the result of human intervention or design. The 1992 Toyota Celica parked in your neighbor's driveway, for example, is the result of human engineering and manufacturing, and its form and function reflect the priorities and values of the society that produced it.

"My thoughts:

1. Honda and Toyota have a cult like following. That gives them a few more years to study the market and decide where and how to position themselves. 

2. Honda and Toyota possibly have a problem long term if they don‚Äôt position themselves correctly. Their brands are built on the perception of low maintenance and mechanical reliability. If EVs do take over they are inherently low maintenance and mechanically reliable by nature of their simpler drivetrain. Suddenly that‚Äôs a narrowing gap for Toyota and Honda. 

3. Toyota made the point that, right now, it‚Äôs very hard to build an EV for the same price point as an ICE vehicle. It‚Äôs a valid point that still needs to be addressed. Manufacturers are solving this by under-pricing models and just taking the loss because they want the experience and data for their next vehicle generations. But eventually you need your products to be turning consistent profits. 

All in all, I think Toyota and Honda have until 2025-ish to decide how to handle EVs. I think it would serve them well, if they do decide EVs are the future, to push themselves to be leaders in build quality and software design (in particular, user experience). Those are two big areas a lot of other manufacturers have shown they fall short.",0.21542436,0.72204816,0.06252749

"So financing introduces two potential elements- the dealer‚Äôs willingness to move on the deal (what you‚Äôre looking at with this question) and what the bank might provide in the way of a rebate or subvented rates.

With the latter, it‚Äôs all on the bank and manufacturer for that month‚Äôs programs. Usually this will be a subvented rate. It‚Äôs much less common to see the manufacturer‚Äôs captive lender (I.e. Toyota Financial or GM Financial for example) have a dollar rebate specifically for going through them; excluding leasing, where that‚Äôs super common actually. So it‚Äôs almost certainly nothing with this.

As for the dealership‚Äôs willingness to negotiate? Who knows man, that‚Äôs on them. If the store isn‚Äôt run by idiots, and you‚Äôve even hinted at a cash deal (honestly, just you focusing on the bottom line would tip off most, or at least have them considering you‚Äôre a cash buyer), then probably not at all. Unless you have some relationship or super strong rapport with them, and they trust you to hold the note open for the 90 or 120 days they need, there‚Äôs no point in them negotiating down the deal just to receive profit that will be charged back in full a couple months later.

The decision makers in this- sales and finance managers- are almost certainly getting paid and then charged back on that money coming and then going. Why bother, when the outcome is they personally give up income?

What you‚Äôre apt to get, though, is less turndowns to a deal at all. If it‚Äôs still competitive in your market then there‚Äôs a good chance dealers may just turn your deal away when you push for a cash purchase. Though I doubt you find it too difficult to find a dealer who will just take the cash deal at whatever their pricing policy is. The alternative though, should you be intent on seeing if you can get a better deal this way, is you need to act like a finance customer. Which means negotiating on monthly payment.

3. any mechanical faults. etc
4. ask verbally, if ok, to go for an advanced pre-inspection, before buying. If there is a hesitation from the seller, then you can assume, there is something wrong with the car, without even needing to see the car :-)
5. if above steps are ok, get a paint tester([https://www.amazon.ae/Eacam-Coating-Thickness-0-2000um-Automotive/dp/B09QLWCR2C/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=car+paint+tester&amp;qid=1680151294&amp;sr=8-3](https://www.amazon.ae/Eacam-Coating-Thickness-0-2000um-Automotive/dp/B09QLWCR2C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=car+paint+tester&amp;qid=1680151294&amp;sr=8-3))  and do a physical inspection of the paint.

"Yup, so for a while You and and Reina basically serve as the vehicles for the Toyota ad placement. 

A lot of these Chinese/Japanese/Korean cohabitation/dating/romance/slice of life/etc. reality shows are sponsored by some car companies. You'll notice this as they often put the car as center of the frame/scene (sometimes they do glamor shots too), especially when they're going for the groceries or to the locations for the dates. Or like the credits will mention at the end that they were sponsored by certain brands.

In Chinese dating shows, they actually begin almost every episode with the list of their major sponsors, lol, the main host/panelist can sometimes take several seconds to recite the brands. 

And then within the episode, they'll have the housemates randomly break the verisimilitude to create an ad for one of the brands. So for example, in Twinkle Love, sometimes in the middle of a date they just randomly start drinking the flavored drink, lol. The Chinese panelists will usually do the ad placement too, but the housemates doing it themselves is often so jarring, lol.

In Korean dating shows, they're a bit more subtle and it's less frequent, but it's often still there (it's actually everywhere but not as in your face as the Chinese shows). For example they sometimes have these $500/1000+ dehumidifiers, Samsung smart fridges, or those luxury massage chairs, lol. And then the housemates will use them at some point or mention those products.

Basically if they're using a particular product, it may or may not be sponsored. Oh and for Terrace House remember that they wear certain clothes from the brands of their friends or previous Terrace House members.

There are behind the scenes shows like **UnREAL with Rachel or Shiri Appleby** for western/Anglo/American/etc. dating shows or shows like The Bachelor.

And then **Love is for Suckers** (has Lee Da-hee, one of the panelists of Single's Inferno (2), as the producer or main character there, and Super Junior's Choi Si-won as the male lead) is a more modern Korean drama version, it'll show you how Korean/East Asian dating shows are created.

Those behind the scenes shows will explain more in detail how exactly they kinda produce these shows. And like how despite it being more like slice of life, the manufactured drama/situations is what keeps people engaged and all that.

There are 3 options and the lower options are pretty reasonable by electric car costs now. The challenge is that options are not the best right now and they are all super expensive right now. The cheapest car right now is the leaf and that goes for 35k-38k. I have heard it does horrible in the snow. The ID4 I looked at is not much cheaper with the AWD version and is only 6.7 inches from the ground. A lot of the other options I saw in the 40k range were the same where they simply did not have the ground clearance I wanted. I read you want 8 inch ground clearance for snow and simply put most EV do not have that. The Toyota that was developed along side the Subaru Solterra as the partnership has 8.1 ground clearance and is much cheaper but the base model is only rear wheel drive. The Ford f-150 lightening sounds amazing on google with its 8.4 ground clearance and it is supposed to start at 55k. Issue with the ford f-150 lightening is dealerships are selling them for 40k+ over MSRP. I asked on the f-150 lightening reddit why they were selling so high over what google says MSRP should be but was just lambasted about skipping the line. When I tried to get in line for the f-150 lightening the dealership said no. I am certainly not paying 40k over asking price for a car/truck/SUV. Particularly when I can get a comparable SUV to the truck for far less. Well the Rivian has 15 inch ground clearance which sound amazing. Oh wait the Rivian costs 75k+ and sells for 100k+.

"There‚Äôs still several decent compact and subcompact cars available in the US, but I think there‚Äôs a few factors at play. 

Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, and Kia still sell a lot of these that range the gamut from extremely to generally reliable. Cars like the Accord, Civic, Corolla, Prius, and Camry (which isn‚Äôt really compact) are legendary for their reliability and longevity and are mostly interesting to drive if something small is what you need. Hyundai has stepped up a lot with its Elantra and Sonata as well. 

And cities still see quite a few cars, as parking is often at a premium; not many trucks where I live. 

I think American manufacturers have decided to only maintain token compact car manufacturing outside luxury brands to satisfy fleet average fuel efficiency, as it‚Äôs easier to meet efficiency standards with larger vehicles, and Asian manufacturers have simply dominated the market for so long. 

This may be also a chicken and egg problem. Auto manufacturers blame low sales, but aside from a few models by largely Asian makes, most compact and subcompact vehicles in an affordable range today (sub-30k) just aren‚Äôt interesting or fun to drive, and often have shitty amenities unless you upgrade to the top trim level. OTOH, base model Hyundais and Toyotas come standard with backup cameras, adaptive cruise, Apple CarPlay, and power everything and typically sell for just a bit more than base model Fords and Chevys of similar size.  Add their reputation for reliability on top of that and there‚Äôs a reason you see a lot of them on the road. 

Another issue is people say they feel safer in an SUV or truck, and many prefer being higher up off the ground. This may have been less of an issue for cars a few decades ago, but modern efficiency standards resulted in smaller vehicles that are lower to the ground and lighter. I know a lot of people who say they won‚Äôt buy a sedan or compact because they can‚Äôt fit in them comfortably, so they stick to compact SUVS or bigger. 

Since you can get a compact or mid sized SUV for only a few grand more than a compact car that often has fewer amenities, they also sell better.

Today the focus is on EVs that get much higher margins, and are often larger because it allows for larger batteries, so longer ranges. And I‚Äôd be very surprised if we don‚Äôt see a glut of EV SUVs (EUVs?) over the next decade. Electric trucks are already selling like hotcakes; contractors can‚Äôt get enough of them for their torque and ability to act as mobile generators.",0.037165083,0.51160634,0.45122856

"&gt;I don‚Äôt even know what 1080ti means lol

It's the model and tier of the graphics card. Just like how a Toyota Camry model comes in several tiers such as LE, SE, XLE, TRD V6, etc. Nvidia's 10 Series cards has several tiers as well (e.g. 1030, 1050ti, etc.). The 1080ti is the top of the line for the 10 Series. 

The rule of thumb for solid performance is to look for parts that are newer than the game's requirements. For example, HL's **minimum** GPU [requirements](https://www.pcmag.com/news/can-your-pc-run-hogwarts-legacy) are at least a GTX 960.

The Toyota RAV4 hybrid engine works kind of like how you can ride a bike with or without using the pedals.

Sometimes, the car uses a special gas engine just like most cars do. Other times, it uses an electric motor that gets its power from a battery. And sometimes it uses both at the same time, like when you use both the pedals and the electric motor on an e-bike to go faster.

When the car needs to go fast or when you press down hard on the gas pedal, the gas engine will work. When the car needs to go slow or when you stop, the electric motor will take over and use the battery to power the car.

And when you're driving at a steady speed, the car might use a combination of the gas engine and the electric motor. All these different ways of moving work together to make the car more efficient and better for the environment!",0.01391841,0.6512298,0.33485177

"&gt; I don‚Äôt know how the RAV4 is so popular honestly. The seats in that thing felt like they two stone slabs mashed together at an angle. The interior is pretty low quality from what I‚Äôm used to seeing in Toyota vehicles, and the tech‚Ä¶ they were using the same damn navigation system in that thing that they used in Lexus cars during the early 00‚Äôs. It is an abysmal waste of money if you ask me, especially if they‚Äôre marking it up so high that it‚Äôs essentially the same price as a Lexus.

So I can tell you that it has _slightly_ better mileage, it has _slightly_ more cargo space and is apparently better at dealing with off-road conditions (whatever that means for a unibody car like the RAV4) than the Lexus. The thing that is surprising to me is that when you consider the markup and say you are getting the premium packaging, the price of that puppy is coming close to the Lexus. But I hardly ever see the Lexus NX450H in the streets, but there are loads of people around me who are apparently paying those premiums for the RAV4 Primes.


&gt; . Lexus is a luxury brand so they know they can‚Äôt treat customers like that so you actually get treated like a real person and not just a wallet with legs like people at Toyota dealerships do.

This is good to hear, I have had some absurd experiences with Toyota dealerships. Like, I need to have bought a car from a dealership to buy a new car from them.  I haven't yet talked to a Lexus dealership yet. 



&gt; When it comes to resale value, Toyotas do hold their value a touch better than a Lexus will, but you‚Äôre also getting a hybrid which will hurt resale value as it gets older because the batteries for hybrid systems do go bad and they‚Äôre not a cheap replacement. If you were looking at the regular gas versions then the RAV4 would hold it a bit better, but Lexus SUVs hold their value incredibly well, far better than other luxury brands do. With them being the hybrid versions though, the resale value will be less than what the gas powered trims will down the road.

I see. This is a good data point to have. The way I am thinking about this, getting the plug in hybrid seems like the middle path of the best of both worlds with ICE vs electric. I can't quite commit to electric right now. Especially because I am doing long trips and like the idea of fill up a car and go.

"From Bloomberg:

A luxury car tax in Singapore is helping push the cost of owning a BMW or Mercedes to the equivalent of a typical local family‚Äôs entire income for the year.

In the city-state‚Äôs latest bi-monthly auction, 125 bidders successfully offered as much as S$116,020 ($87,000) just for the right to own an ‚Äúopen category"" auto, which can be applied toward any vehicle type but frequently ends up being used for larger cars in the densely-populated island.

That means the cost of a 10-year ownership permit ‚Äî the car isn‚Äôt included ‚Äî is equivalent to 92% of the nation‚Äôs median annual household income.

The latest figures come despite government hikes on additional registration fees for cars valued at over S$40,000, a move expected to generate an additional S$200 million in the coming budget year while impacting the top one-third of newly registered cars by market value.

The higher government-imposed fee follows an influx of new wealth from places including Hong Kong, mainland China and India after Singapore became one of the first Asian financial centers to successfully emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. But the latest bidding round shows that the higher tax isn‚Äôt having much impact.

Despite a widely lauded public transit system, in which a bus or subway ride can cost less than S$1, there will always be people in this city of 5.6 million who still want to own a private vehicle ‚Äî or maybe more than one ‚Äî and can afford to pay, said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking.

The pricey ownership rights are the result of a quota system that controls the number of autos allowed on the nation‚Äôs streets, helping limit congestion and pollution, through the twice-a-month bidding process. Bid successfully and your shiny new Mercedes-Benz becomes road-worthy.

When the overall quota of permits was reduced by 14% and premiums skyrocketed to a then-record high in November last year, luxury models benefited the most, with Mercedes vehicles surpassing Toyota models as the top auto brand registered. In fact, in recent months one in every four cars registered was either a Mercedes-Benz or BMW.

Rising prices have also been driven by a growing appetite for electric and hybrid models, which have accounted for more than half of new purchases so far this year. In Singapore, owning a car such as a Tesla Model 3 Performance could quickly surpass $200,000, depending on the vehicle‚Äôs features and the price paid for the permit.

For Singaporeans who just want an ordinary vehicle to get to their office or a weekend movie, the hope is that the supply of 10-year entitlements begins to stabilize, a shift that is expected after an adjustment the government‚Äôs Land Transport Authority recently made.

But for the time being, costs are still trending up. And if you need a car now, the next auction takes place April 5.",0.05825682,0.7878994,0.15384375

"Hola, como contras en un corolla, siendo que el primer corolla que tuve fue seg autom√°tico 2005, el segundo seg autom√°tico 2010 y el tercero un xei cvt del 2015, y la pandemia hizo que no lo cambiara a√∫n, es m√°s, tengo m√°s ganas de tomarme el palo que de cambiar el auto üòÇ...

Tema estacionamiento, no es drama, te va a pasar en todos lados y con cualquier auto, no es que vas a estacionar un Scania con semi de 14 metros o una ram en una callecita...es un veh√≠culo de tama√±o normal...

Como contras, de un mediano vs un auto chico, en un corolla ten√©s gastos de cubiertas que son el doble que en un auto chico (en esta escasez que se viene, va a ser un gasto importante) y consumo de combustible en ciudad que es mayor que en un auto chico, alrededor entre unos 11-13km/l, mientras que un ford ka haces 15km. En ruta yendo a 100/110 hac√©s unos 15-17km por litro con control crucero, al menos todos los modelos que tuve/tengo...

Temas gastos de services o mantenimiento es similar al resto de autos, los repuestos no son para nada imposibles. Me fijo antes de comprar cualquier auto, claramente he tenido suerte y no he tenido que gastar en nada mas que en pavadas. Los autos franceses o volkswagen tienen repuestos m√°s caros que Toyota, en general...asi que es un golazo.

Como contras o desventajas, si quer√©s viajar a la Patagonia, ten√© en cuenta que los tramos en el sur, son largos y la autonomia de los hibridos (si compras el m√°s full de todos) no es tanta como los modelos viejos porque el tanque es de 43 litros (38 + 5 reserva), vs los 55L de los 1.8 mas viejos y si bien de toyota te dicen que la autonomia es de 500km, en el sur te agarra un tramo largo con viento en contra (algo normal) vas a cortar clavos y hacer todos los calculos posibles pensando si llegas o no (tengo un conocido que con un hibrido yendo no tan fuerte, no llegan o llegan de pedo de cordoba a rosario - 400km y en el sur a veces tenes tramos de m√°s de esa distancia, en el m√≠o hac√©s m√°s de 700-800 con un tanque, tranqui)...

Otro tema, es que el despeje al suelo, los corolla son bajos, por ende si hac√©s algunos caminos de tierra, va a tocar en casi todos lados, ac√° en C√≥rdoba en los lomos de burro y badenes, si los pasas mal y llevas gente, casi de seguro que toc√°s el piso, en el sur tambi√©n...a parte de eso, es un autazo y dentro de lo que hay es lo m√°s viable de comprar. Si le hac√©s el mantenimiento que te dice el manual, no se rompe, es un antes y un despu√©s de un corolla desde el punto de vista del mantenimiento y confiabilidad...

Mi experiencia, en casi 20 a√±os de usar corollas (del primero del 2005 a hoy), no cambi√© m√°s que l√°mparas, cubiertas, cambios de aceite/filtros cada 10-15 mil km, 1 s√≥lo juego de pastillas de freno porque ya tenian 100k y hab√≠an empezado a hacer ruido, 2 guardaplast que se rompieron (1 en el seg del 2010 y otro en el 2015), 2 cambios de bater√≠a, y como grave, al seg del 2010 fall√≥ la tercera y no entraba (automatico) y me la cambiaron por garant√≠a... Aparte de eso, tuve que hacer soldar el ca√±o de escape dos veces al mismo seg 2010 porque se perdia una goma que lleva y hacia que se rompa...salvo eso, realmente ning√∫n tipo de drama, por ende, para mi, que no me pinta renegar, perder el tiempo, amagarle a la llave y que prenda, caer en mec√°nicos, etc, con esta experiencia, realmente no hay con qu√© darle a los toyota corolla...",0.051243678,0.7799667,0.16878964

You have stressed that you are looking for reliability and comfort. On both these points a naturally-aspirated Mazda, Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Kia may suit you. Do not focus on the engine size too much.
Consider what insurance category it is in.  They are likely to be decently equipped.

Insurers look to mitigate their risk. Either the car is safe. Or, it is unlikely that the performance of the car doesn‚Äôt lead to many collisions. Insurers will have significant metrics on this. Engine size is just one factor.

If you are considering ‚Äòcomfort‚Äô look towards a car equipped with cruise control. It makes long journeys far more tolerable and allows you to better focus on the road and traffic around you.

"I'm not saying that there aren't safety concerns with them, but those safety issues exist in just as many large SUVs that are on our roads in greater numbers than the American trucks. Yet the American trucks are the only ones that are continuously highlighted as 'dangerously unsafe'.

The 2022 Toyota Landcruiser is only 6cm more narrow than a Ford F150, the Hyundai Palisade is also only 6cm more narrow and the BMW X7 is a mere 4cm narrower. All are about the same height with a similar ground clearence.

Environmentally, a RAM 1500 has a combined emissions of 283 CO^(2) g/km and the Hyundai Palisade is at 251 CO^(2) g/km (both petrol). That difference is a 5th of a 2022 Ford Fiesta petrol.

&gt;completely unnecessary.

I'm not doubting that there are people out there driving a American truck that they don't require, but I have two guys on my worksite that both drive RAM 1500. They are mobile plant operators who work on contract and own their own plant. They need the payload capacity of the 1500 so that they can transport their plant to and from site (not every day, but they might be on my site 2 days a week and then on another 2 days a week). The payload and tow capacity is also required for their diesel tankers so they can tow them on site and fill up the plant equipment. A commercial truck wouldn't work because of the conditions on site.

I would argue that given there are more large SUV on the road and the majority of those are used for school runs and shopping trips that there is a higher likelihood that those vehicles are 'unnecessary' for the tasks they are used for. Plus they have the same safety issues and environmental impacts as well as a higher likelihood of being driven in densely populated areas at peak hours.

That's why I consider all these complaints about American trucks 'Not In My Streets!', there are plentiful examples of other vehicles that are just as dangerous and pollute just as much yet there are never any complaints about them.",0.6283695,0.35082036,0.020810159

"A couple things:

Not every race Fassbender does is a 24 hour race.  His ultimate goal is to make it to the Le Mans 24 Hour, but it‚Äôs a process to get there in the first place.  In the class that Fassbender races in, there are a limited number of entry slots for Le Mans, so he must first qualify for one of those entry spots.

For reference, the Le Mans 24 Hour is one of the races in the World Endurance Championship (WEC).

In order to gain experience and qualify for Le Mans, Fassbender and his team have been racing in a lower tier series called the European Le Mans Series (ELMS).  This is a European regional series that does 4 hour endurance races on a variety of European circuits.  Placing high enough in your class in the ELMS championship can earn you an invitation to the Le Mans 24 Hour.

The other way to get to Le Mans is to enter the full WEC championship, which automatically includes Le Mans (but doing a full season of WEC is hella expensive, mostly due to freight, since the car and equipment needs to get shipped to the 4 corners of Earth).

There is also an Asian Le Mans Series (AsLMS) which follows the exact same rules as ELMS; and there is also an American regional series that has slightly different rules, but overall is basically the same.  The American series is the IMSA Weathertek Sportscar Championship.

In ELMS, the series which Michael has been racing in, there are 3 classes of car:  LMP2, LMP3, and GTE (soon to be renamed GT3 for 2024).  

LMP stands for Le Mans Prototype.  These cars are the ‚Äúspaceship‚Äù looking race cars that have almost a fighter jet style cockpit.  LMP3 is like an entry level class before drivers move up to LMP2.

GTE (GT3) are the cars which look like their road-going counterparts.  Fassbender drivers a Porsche 911, against Aston Martins, Ferraris, etc.  The GT cars are the slowest class of the 3.

For a 4 hour ELMS race, all 3 classes of cars race on the circuit at the same time.  They all start the race at the exact same time.

The LMP2 cars are much faster than the LMP3 cars, which in turn are much faster than the GT cars.  This means that the lead LMP cars start lapping the much slower GT cars very early in the race, and continue to do so throughout the whole race.  By the end of a 4 hour, the lead LMP cars will have lapped most of the GT cars over 10 times.

Although the 3 classes are on track at the exact same time, they are not competing directly against one another.  Each class has its own winner, it‚Äôs own podium, and it‚Äôs own championship standings.  The checkered flag comes out at the end of 4 hours, and whichever car is leading their respective class wins that class.  Technically speaking, there is also an overall finishing order classification, and it is possible for cars from lower classes to finish ahead of cars from higher classes, but this only happens due to extreme circumstances and is not very common in the modern era.

Within each class, there are specific rules regarding minimum driver times for the lowest rated driver.  So for his catagory, Fassbender being the lowest rated driver on the team, he must do a minimum of iirc 90 minutes of the 4 hour event (I could be wrong about the specific time).  How the team wants to distribute that 90 minutes is up to their strategist(s), but it must be 90 in total for Fassbender.

One of either Fassbender or Lietz will start the race, and then during one of the pit stops, the one driving will hop out of the car, and the one not driving will jump in.  The driver change takes all of 15-20 seconds, less than the time it takes to refill the fuel tank.  There‚Äôs a huge range of strategies and factors that goes into deciding which driver will drive which portion of the race.

In the World Endurance Championship, everything is bigger, and faster.  The shortest races are 6 hours long, and the longest is the 24 Hour of Le Mans.

The classes are a step up as well.  There are 4 of them:

Hypercar (LMH, LMDH) - these are the fastest closed cockpit cars in the world.  Again these are the ones that look like space ships with fighter cockpits.  These cars are actually Hybrids, with a gas engine and then electric assistance provided through regenerative breaking and heat recovery.  Stupid fast, basically the only thing faster is an F1 car.  Pro teams from the likes of Toyota, Porsche, Ferrari, Cadillac, Peugeot, and soon to be BMW, Alpine (Renault), and more.  Every single driver in this category is a pro driver, many of them have F1 experience, and most are amongst the best racing drivers in the world.

LMP2 - this is the same class as the one in ELMS, it‚Äôs just not the top class in WEC.  Teams are a mix of pro and am drivers.  The Am drivers provide all/most of the funding, and the Pro drivers are hired hot-shoes.

GTE-Pro - these are GT cars, driven by pro drivers, run by factory teams like Ferrari, Porsche, Corvette, Aston Martin, etc.

GTE-Am - these are GT cars, driven by a mix of Pro and Am drivers.  This is the class that Fassbender would race in if he makes it to Le Mans.  For the longer distance races, the team would also bring on a 3rd, maybe even 4th driver.  Bringing on another Am driver brings more money to the team, brining another Pro costs more money, but could mean better results.  Just like in the ELMS, there are rules regarding minimum drive times for the Bronze rated drivers.

So at Le Mans every year, and in every WEC race, there are 4 winners, and 4 podiums.

The reason they race with everyone on track all at the same time is purely to create chaos.  For Le Mans, there are over 60 cars on track at the same time.  For the faster classes, it makes it so it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre racing through traffic on the freeway, because they have to weave through all the slower cars.",0.02588838,0.78957796,0.18453373

"On the inside it's mostly a normal Sentra, however the driving feel is a bit different, the turbo steering is a bit more responsive, and a bit more stable in the corners. The engine makes the car faster than a 4 cylinder Altima but not quite as fast as the 6-cylinder Maxima. The CVT is... Uh... Well, it's there. Try to get an extended warranty that covers the transmission for a long time and you should be fine. When it's working correctly, the CVT is a nice combination of responsive when desired and smooth/fuel efficient when not. 

Of the options listed, the turbo is the fastest, and most sporty, but bear in mind it requires premium fuel. Regular or mid-grade won't necessarily hurt it, but it won't run as efficiently as possible, and may contribute to excessive carbon build-up on the valves - this car is prone to that, so you'll also want to do a carbon cleaning (""fuel induction"") service every 30k miles or so, which is also about how often you might consider changing the CVT fluid. Change the oil and filter using synthetic 0W-20 every 5k miles should keep it happy. 

If you don't want the turbo, next best option is the normal Sentra, although the base models of those can be pretty sparse on the interior. SL and SR trim levels are the two highest-equipped, with the SR being a bit more sporty and the SL a bit more ""high-tech."" SV trim level is the in-between, a few options here and there, you'll just have to see what it's got when you get in.

The C-Max I have uses the same power-split planetary gear e-CVT architecture as the Toyota hybrids.  It is a pleasant enough driving experience but susceptible to failure over the long haul.

The CR-V AWD is mechanical where the RAV4 is electronic with a separate motor.  The CR-V provides a better experience particularly on snow.  We live in a cold climate so we opted for the better snow traction.  

Honda could have squeezed more MPG out of the CR-V but would have sacrificed regarding size, comfort, and mechanical AWD.  Getting better MPG is always good but there is always a tradeoff.

"Lexus. Hands down. 

In 2021 my mom was shopping for a new car and had her heart dead set on a RAV4. She was incredibly busy so I spent a whole day going around to the different dealerships around town and testing cars at the same size as the RAV4, and every single one of them was miserable to be in, including the RAV4. I drive a Lexus and she really likes it, so I decided to check them out as well and see if Toyota actually put an ounce of effort into the RAV4‚Äôs luxury equivalent, and man was it good. It was outstanding to put it simply. The comfort is top notch, it‚Äôs got a really nice amount of get up and go and even handles fairly well. The only reason she didn‚Äôt buy it was because the backseat was too small for my younger brother to stay in during long road trips.

I don‚Äôt know how the RAV4 is so popular honestly. The seats in that thing felt like they two stone slabs mashed together at an angle. The interior is pretty low quality from what I‚Äôm used to seeing in Toyota vehicles, and the tech‚Ä¶ they were using the same damn navigation system in that thing that they used in Lexus cars during the early 00‚Äôs. It is an abysmal waste of money if you ask me, especially if they‚Äôre marking it up so high that it‚Äôs essentially the same price as a Lexus. 

The other bonus of going with Lexus is the dealerships. Toyota isn‚Äôt bad with their dealerships, certainly nowhere near as bad as Ford or Nissan, but they sit out front like a bunch of vultures waiting to swoop at you. Lexus is a luxury brand so they know they can‚Äôt treat customers like that so you actually get treated like a real person and not just a wallet with legs like people at Toyota dealerships do. 

When it comes to resale value, Toyotas do hold their value a touch better than a Lexus will, but you‚Äôre also getting a hybrid which will hurt resale value as it gets older because the batteries for hybrid systems do go bad and they‚Äôre not a cheap replacement. If you were looking at the regular gas versions then the RAV4 would hold it a bit better, but Lexus SUVs hold their value incredibly well, far better than other luxury brands do. With them being the hybrid versions though, the resale value will be less than what the gas powered trims will down the road.",0.2359439,0.4967044,0.26735166

"&gt;	Little ones the size of the Courier, D50, Arrow, LUV, P'UP. The ones killed off by the Chicken Tax.

Chicken Tax has nothing to do with vehicle size, only where it‚Äôs built. 

&gt;	Toyota was the only foreign company that did what the 25% import duty on light trucks was intended to force. 

Every single pickup, from the RidgeLine to F-350, sold in the US is built in the US (or Mexico or Canada because of trade agreements) is because of the Chicken tax, not even remotely exclusive to the HiLux. Most SUVs sold in the states are also built in those countries as they are also Light Trucks (ie most of BMW's SUV lineup).

&gt;	But Ford replaced the Courier with the larger Ranger and the embiggening of small pickups started. Toyota at some point gave theirs an enlargement and a name, Tacoma.

Which has nothing to do with the Chicken Tax. The [Tacoma](https://i.imgur.com/XnhrQi2.jpeg) started off compact when it replaced the [HiLux](https://i.imgur.com/SOYXaqZ.jpeg)/Pickup, and then the [HiLux](https://i.imgur.com/ifQe68l.png) and [Tacoma](https://i.imgur.com/i8usXbM.png) independently both became midsized trucks in 2004. None of the international pickups (including those that aren't and never have been sold in the states) are [notably smaller](https://i.imgur.com/EriTWEG.png) (from left to right: Mazda BT-50, Toyota HiLux, Ford Ranger, Nissan Navara, Mitsubishi Triton, Holden Colorado, VW Amarok, Isuzu D-Max) than the current crop of midsized pickups available in America. 

The HiLux is actually a great example because it was built at the NUMMI plant (where Tesla now) before it was replaced by the Tacoma, so the Chicken Tax already didn‚Äôt apply to it. You get the Taco because it‚Äôs built specifically for US intrests and the HiLux isn‚Äôt. 

That‚Äôs not to mention the Chicken Tax has been in place since 1964, the small trucks of the 90s were built under the same rules that exist now. 

The only ones that are actually smaller are the handful of unibody vehicles sold in select countries (normally South American or African) like the [VW Saveiro](https://i.imgur.com/GYLYqFw.png), or the Japanese BoF cabover kei trucks, like the [Daihatsu HiJet.](https://i.imgur.com/R7Divzo.png)",0.36131555,0.59883505,0.0398494

"Yeah, some Toyotas and Hondas are crazy expensive even used, Subaru has that same problem in the US but not over here, not many people know the brand, and in the case of the Outback the model itself is pretty unknown, so it's not very expensive for the car you're getting, you can get a good deal. The new Outbacks sold in Mexico are actually a generation behind the ones the US are selling as new, look at the websites and you can compare, I suppose they did this to make the cars not as expensive.  2015 Outbacks when new where going for around $550,000 MXN for the top of the line 3.6 limited and 2017 ones where going for around $700,000MXN for the same model. Around $300,000 is a good price.   


So like I mentioned eyesight wasn't something Subaru sold in Mexico until like 2019, so any model earlier than that might not have it the 2014,2015 and 2017 (I'm pretty sure they skipped 2016...not sure why) Outbacks won't have it here, same goes for Foresters and Crosstreks/XV. And also, all cars as far as I know require premium fuel over here because...well Pemex reputation, even more important if you buy a new Outback with a turbo and direct injection.   


I have a dealership here in my town so routine service is not an issue, some parts however can be.  I bought my 2015 in 2017 and it was the demo unit the dealership had, bought it since it was at a good discount, only had like 400 kilometers and they gave me the full 5 year warranty... I used that warranty quite a bit on stuff that would break on a demo car: electric windows, power liftgate and electric mirrors. Power liftgate motor was changed within 2 weeks, so ok, mirrors and electric windows control unit took about a month to get here and be installed, the worst was actually a door handle on the rear passenger side that broke, it took almost 4 months to get the part, I was actually about to drive to the US (I live about 3 hours away from the border) and buy the part over there, but I'd already paid for it. Another pain point can be getting a new windshield glass as the factory one is notorious for chipping/getting cracks...but Plinkton makes a windshield for the outback and has a factory over in Mexicalli, so it can be gotten quicker outside of the dealership, I got mine within 2 weeks, and that includes dealing with the insurance company.  


I have not had any issues (at least so far) with the CVT transmission in my car, but do note that after 6 years (or 100,000KMs) inspection/changing of the fluid is recommended. Originally it was meant to be a ""sealed unit with fluid for life"" but that changed quickly when early CVTs started having issues (mostly around 2012), if buying used see if the owner has done that service. It will be 6 years on october for me so I'll be insisting they change the fluid on that service, even if it makes it a bit more expensive.   


I've written a lot already so I don't want to make this longer, but I do really like my Outback, it's perfect for the roads here in Mexico and an handle you going off road or taking roads that are really really bad (though it's not a proper 4x4 low car, don't get overconfident) and in the rain or in those partially flooded streets that sometimes happen over here it is super capable, while managing to be really comfortable on the highway/properly paved roads. It has very comfortable seats for adults in the front and back and you can carry a lot of things in it, even more if you fold the rear seats.

"Check out the 2023 Toyota Prius, it was redesigned this year and is a big, noticeable improvement over previous years. It looks great, it has a faster powertrain with similar fuel economy, and the base LE model comes in under $30k but is still well equipped. The only reason you'd go Corolla Hybrid is if you really need to save money vs the Prius LE, but I really think the new Prius is worth the extra cash, especially if you plan to keep it for a long time and maintain it well. Elantra Hybrid is also great, and the Civic is coming out with a hybrid version in 2024 that should be great too. The Civic's interior space and ergonomics would be the best of the bunch.

There aren't many hybrid crossovers for $30k or less new, but there are a couple options worth considering. The Kia Niro is redesigned for 2023, with the EX trim coming in just a hair over $30k. It could be worth the extra money if the more boxy crossover-like packaging better meets your needs. The ringer here, though, is the Ford Maverick. Yes, it's a pickup, but the base model is a hybrid that gets 37 combined MPG. It's small, so it'll still work great in cities, but the cab is well laid out for its size, and having a bed for cargo can be really convenient.

Your claim of drop in tech also doesnt make sense, you can't drop in an all solid state sulfide electrolyte into existing factories, you would need to retool everything from the milling and extrusion phase since the electrolyte would need to be incorporated into the cathode material, all under inert and isolated atmosphere, which adds additional retooling.

Also has SLDP managed to get out A samples yet? Last I heard they were still struggling to get a 50% silicon anode to work with their sulfide electrolyte, that was back in 2021 when the last set of cycling data was released, has there been any update on that?

"I moved here from Kitchener, and I have  to agree with many of the sentiments above. 

Firstly, I do find the people here more friendly. It definitely has the small-town feeling that Kitchener had 30 years ago. 

The trails aren‚Äôt as good as the ones in KW. I still drive back there to do my long hikes. 

There needs to be better retail. An indoor shopping centre of some kind. I find we travel to Masonville or Conestoga mall weekly, to shop for things that simply don‚Äôt exist here. 

We recently had a bubble tea place open - BoBar. They didn‚Äôt have smoothies, which was an oversight on their part. They‚Äôve changed that now, so I‚Äôm not driving to Waterloo to get a good bubble tea. 

The work around here is solid, for a small town. VuTeq, TigerCat, and Toyota (to name a few big guys). Otherwise, it‚Äôs mostly service based.  I still work (and likely will forever) for a company based out of town. 

The hospital is great. Much better than either options in KW. I‚Äôm unsure of the schools, though, as my child is not yet of age. 

All in all, I‚Äôm very happy my wife and I bought a house here. We‚Äôre both a lot happier here.

"So here is my list:

1) Make a folder in chronological order to keep record of every maintenance, the date, mileage and what was done. This is a very easy tasks that adds resale value.
2) Follow the owner's manual maintenance intervals, and what has to be check or changed at each one. Usually maintenance for toyota happens every 5k miles or 6 months whatever happens first. Continue to do this maintenance for the whole life of the car.
3) Change oil  and oil filter every 5k miles or 6 months, whatever happens first. This is the single most important task, never ever skip it, and remember to use the right type of oil as stated in the owner's manual.
4) use the correct gasoline with the correct octanes, again follow the owner's manual. Tip: never ever use fuel aditives, they are not needed and will harm your car.
5) check tire pressure every 2 to 3 weeks, and keep them inflated to the correct pressure. The pressure info is in a sticker at the door frame of the driver.
6) when a car is new, don't drive it too hard or accelerate too fast until the first oil change. New engines will leave some small metal particles while the pistons, rings and cylinder ""settle"", this is potentially harmful if you slam the accelerator, so go easy before the first oil change.
7) keep the car clean, even inside, as the dust might clog the hybrid battery fan filter, and the hybrid battery could degrade early.

"In numerous key European and Asian markets, you cannot buy the biggest monstrosities brand new because they aren't homologated for those markets for one or more of the following reasons:

1. Excess weight = outright ban or high annual taxes
2. Excess fuel consumption where gas prices are 2x what they cost in America
3. Large displacement engines = very high annual taxes (hilariously this leads to large luxury cars like the Mercedes S-class being sold with 4-cylinder engines in these markets)
4. Massive length/width means these things literally can't fit on many streets and parking spaces, particularly pre-WW2 European roads

I have yet to see European and Asian blue-collar workers complain about an inability to perform their duties despite not having access to F150s and Rams.

"Toyota's hybrids are extremely reliable but calling an electric motor or battery pack a single 'part' is incredibly misleading. As an example the Prius' battery pack consists of 28 modules with 6 cells each (168 parts alone), and that's not including any of the bits required to bundle that together.

And your list isn't extensive, it needs 3 inverters and 2 converters, a power control unit to control how all of the motors work together was well as the gear or chain drive (depending on generation) that connects the planetary gear to the diff, and that's not to include all of the various sensors required to keep track of all of the motors and electronics and the wiring to plug all of this in. There's also the exhaust heat recirculation system to bring the engine and cat up to temp faster, and a separate cooling system for one of the inverters. Later gens of the HSD system also have a second planetary gearset for MG2. PHEV models also add a sprag clutch between the engine and the gearbox and also have to add all the bits and pieces required to mount a charging port on the car, some models also gain heat pump so the engine doesn't have to be engaged for cabin heat.

It's reliable because most of that crap is solid state and doesn't require maintenance (you'll only have issues if stuff outright fails) but there very much is more parts than a standard ICE car, the battery alone probably has more individual parts than a normal automatic transaxle.",0.43582645,0.479406,0.08476753

"The first EVs really only started rolling out 10 years ago. The average age of a car on the road today is 12 years old.

Those first EVs were Tesla Roadsters that are essentially exotic sports cars.

The EVs that have been released are all luxury cars save for those near useless Nissan Leafs with something like 90 miles of range. They would make for great little city cars but you honestly could go without even owning a car in a city.

Cars are more of a suburbia/rural thing since there is no easy access to mass transit. You would have to drive to it anyways.

EV cars certainly have their place and definitely it will be nice to see more of them be released and actually start hitting affordable levels. The tech is far from ready for being in a truck and the availability and cost for these vehicles really only make them available for the rich. A 100k for a Silverado or F150?  Really? People are already flipping out over ICE work trucks being over 40k. Not to mention these trucks aren't really good for truck stuff due to the range and their weight is incredibly more than their ICE counterpart. That Hummer EV is something like 9000 lbs and it takes a hell of a time to charge due to the size of the battery.

Fortunately, GM's new Bolt EUV looks promising as it looks to be affordable and practical, but this is the first year of it and despite me liking GM products I also know GM products are also known to be... Problematic especially when they get older so we shall see how long these last. While Tesla's have bad panel gaps I feel like the money is mostly spent on the tech where as GM finds ways to cram the cheapest tech in its vehicles and that shit breaks. A lot.

I do think Toyota's approach of keeping ICE vehicle production around and mixing it up with hybrids, EVs, and even trying out hydrogen is the way to go.

"&gt;	Earlier this month, a brand-new Ford Mustang rolled into my driveway and hummed itself to a halt. The scene was a straight shot of Americana concentrate: The dirt crunched beneath the car‚Äôs tires; the sun glinted off the red paint on its aptly equine-esque snout, helping it easily outshine every other vehicle on the block. Then the front driver‚Äôs-side door opened, and out emerged not a middle-aged man who‚Äôd bought into the brand‚Äôs bid to be ‚Äúcool, clever, and tough,‚Äù but instead ‚Ä¶ me.

&gt;	Me, with my herbal tea and cat-fur-covered Patagonia backpack, my wallet full of Trader Joe‚Äôs receipts. Me, an Asian American woman in her 30s who hates roller coasters, who‚Äôs never finished an entire serving of beer, and whose ideal car for the past two decades has been a Toyota Prius. ‚ÄúYou are the last person I would expect to buy a Mustang,‚Äù one of my colleagues told me after recovering from a laughing fit. 

&gt;	I do have an explanation for this discrepancy, and it‚Äôs not one that die-hard Mustang fans will necessarily like. My new car is a Mustang‚Äîit‚Äôs just a Mustang Mach-E. It runs on electricity, and the motor, rather than the brand, is the main reason I, and so many others like me, are now in the driver‚Äôs seat. Which means that nowadays, when a Mustang pulls up, ‚Äúyou just have no idea who‚Äôs coming out of that car,‚Äù says Kashef Majid, a marketing expert at the University of Mary Washington, in Virginia. Classically branded electric vehicles are undergoing a battery-powered identity crisis that‚Äôs changing not just their engines, but potentially their passengers too.

I have to say that I find this very relatable. I‚Äôve always loved the ICE Mustangs, but they aren‚Äôt something that I would have even considered buying for myself.",0.048806287,0.67287546,0.2783183

"You're wrong that base price of a Corolla now is 21k. The MSRP of a base 2023 Corolla LE with zero installed accessories and no floor mats is $21,550 but when you include destination and handling (which is a mandatory fee that EVERY buyer has to pay), the total comes to around 23k. A solid 2k more than what you've been stating.

But we're not done there. Corollas are in low supply and have extremely high insane demand. I live in Dallas TX and have been in the market for a new 2023 base Corolla LE for the past 3 months. Every Toyota dealership near me is charging $30,000 out the door (including taxes and fees) for a base 2023 Corolla LE or more! They're also refusing to bring the price down. Why is it 30k? Dealer markup and dealer plus port installed accessories that we're forced to pay for as buyers.

The dealers have no incentive to bring the price down because there are buyers who will pay 30k for a new base Corolla. No joke!

Unfortunately this is the new normal. Most of the major carmakers like Ford, Toyota, Nissan, General Motors etc. have decided to purposely limit new car production so they can keep prices high, keep marketing costs low, and not have to spend money on new car cash rebates.

21k my ass! That's completely wrong! Also just because inflation has been super high for the past 3 years doesn't mean it's ok to simply adjust for inflation and state that the current high prices are reasonable.

"To answer your question‚Ä¶it depends.

Of course, as a 90s Toyota fanatic, I‚Äôm biased towards those early ones. In terms of an ‚Äúabridged first-gen buying guide‚Äù, ideally you want to look for one that was built between 1998-2000. They received a refresh in that year‚Äîcosmetic changes, upgraded head/taillights and side markers, and I believe a small bump in displacement. The desired configurations tend to include the 2-door variant, AWD, and the manual transmission. Bonus points if you get a cool, vibrant colored one.

I have a 1999 4-door with AWD and the manual transmission. I adore it. I plan on keeping it for at least a decade as my daily little work horse. It‚Äôs easy to work on and parts are generally pretty easy to come by. I bought it because I live in an area where there is a lot of packed downtown areas and nature preserves within close proximity. I wanted something I could easily parallel park on a busy street, but could also take on some back country ‚Äúsoft roads‚Äù. It had absolutely exceeded my expectations. I‚Äôve taken it through just about everything reasonable I can think of (blizzards, tropical storms, light mud, snow, ice, gravel) and it keeps on chugging.

Keep in mind, it‚Äôs an old car. Toyotas tend to hold up pretty well, but it‚Äôs going to need some attention. Don‚Äôt expect to pay the previous owner $4000 and be done with costs for years. You‚Äôll need to spend a few thousand over those first few years of ownership to get towards a healthy baseline.

Continuing with some general ‚Äúbuying old car advice‚Äù, take it to a mechanic and have a pre purchase inspection (PPI). It‚Äôll cost you $100 or so, but it could save you thousands in not buying a dud. Don‚Äôt fall in love with the first car you see, there will be more that pop up. If your heart is set on a first gen Rav4, I guarantee you that more will come up for sale. They aren‚Äôt super rare‚Äîwhich again, helps keep them alive.

"P0456 can be very hard to find. A starting point that I would start with is the gas cap. Quick inspection I would do is inspect the gasket for cracking. Then tighten the gas cap; should click. Then has a slight return tension; then tightened again, should hear another click. When tight, check the tension when removing, should not feel loose, this will give you erroneous small evap leak driving down the road. 

Evap system need to be smoke tested/pressure tested. If there is no leakage found. and P0456 still returns. The there could be an internal restriction in the charcoal canister. There should be a canister filter inline from fuel filler to canister. If there is excessive debris build up, more than likely canister is clogged.

If there is no issues found: there is a software update for ECM logic for this code.  Can refer to  T-SB-0042-12 ; This will have be performed by a dealer or a shop that has proper scan tool and access to the reflash files from Toyota.

The worst I see happen is if the vehicle is subjected excessive offroad use. Excessive dirt/dust collects in the canister filter. When the leak detection pump runs, it sucks these into the system and finds its way into the fuel tank. Which then clogs the fuel system such as fuel pump and injectors causing a extended cranking time. This is a severe case that typically happens for owners who live offroad where there is a long stretch of dirt road. 

I would start with replacing a gas cap and clearing the trouble code. Make sure you get a factory gas cap. If codes comes back, then further testing would have be performed and it can be quite extensive.

A chart identifying the particular FMVSS that must be met by Canadian-certified vehicles manufactured after specified production dates is set forth below. Covered vehicles that do not comply with an identified FMVSS can only be lawfully imported if NHTSA has separately decided that they are eligible for importation on a make, model, and model year basis.

"No aftermarket warranty is going to cover emission items or anything that'd be considered a maintenance item. Many will specifically exclude belts and hoses for the reason you mentioned. 

I'd suggest looking for a used vehicle that's marketed as ""Certified"" by a reputable dealer of a good car line.

They will cost a little more since the manufacturer kicks in some financing incentives and the dealer service department has to put in some labor to make them certified but they will actually look it over and make sure it's not a total pile before selling it. 

Not all extended warranties are bad but they are all out to turn a profit, otherwise why would they do it?

"&gt; Yes, a Voron might be bigger and faster but the MK3/MK4 is a very proven and reliable platform

So is the Voron, we have 4 and they just go. All printers need maintenance, all suffer from hotend clogs, beds need cleaned, belts need tensioned/wear.

&gt; If you do not need the size of a large Voron and you don't want to tinker on your Voron then the MK3/MK4 is just the better choice

Vorons do not need to be constantly tinkered on. They *can* be, just like a Prusa. It's just they have a much wider range of mods and customisation. You can also just buy a 250mm Voron, which has a smaller footprint than a Prusa

"RE the federal law thing about 8/100k, if you google it, it's in a zillion places that should be trustworthy (Kelly Blue Book, Car and Driver).

&gt; [ICE] Powertrain warranties can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Typically, they cover at least five years or 60,000 miles, though some last as long as 10 years or 100,000 miles.

&gt;Hybrid and EV battery warranty coverage often lasts longer. Federal law requires automakers to ensure EV and hybrid batteries for at least eight years or 100,000 miles.

&gt;California goes even further, requiring a 10-year, 150,000-mile warranty on EV and hybrid batteries. Toyota has adopted that standard in all 50 states.

The funny thing is I'm very curious where this is specified in US Code.  I'd wager this has to do with emissions control system regulations which DO require an 8 year warranty, in that  manufacturer perhaps has to follow ECS warrantee laws in order to meet CAFE standards.

"The 90s was a bad time for Japanese car makers in the US market, with the yen decreasing in value to the dollar and a dipping US economy.  In the Supra example you gave, the 1993 Turbo model started at $39,900 in 1993 and the price continued to balloon up to $50,400.  After several years of disappointing sales, Toyota tried massive price cuts on the Supra in 1997, when the base model dropped to just $29,500 and the Turbo fell to $39,900.  

The Supra is an interesting case, as the over-engineered 2JZ engine cost a fortune to produce and the chassis made extensive use of aluminum, with an aluminum front subframe for weight savings.

"Ford and the others just won't make the trucks people want. Little ones the size of the Courier, D50, Arrow, LUV, P'UP. The ones killed off by the Chicken Tax.

Toyota was the only foreign company that did what the 25% import duty on light trucks was intended to force. They built a factory in the US to build the Hilux but since all the competition was gone it was simply the no-name Toyota Pickup.

But Ford replaced the Courier with the larger Ranger and the embiggening of small pickups started. Toyota at some point gave theirs an enlargement and a name, Tacoma.

One of these new companies could make a proper tiny pickup, body on frame, RWD and 4x4 or AWD.

"If you handle a San Martin and handle a Patek, and cannot notice the difference, you need to handle more watches. There are plenty of movements that came and should cost over $3k, including those from China.

If you are not into fine watchmaking, good for you. That said, it still exists. Again, why on earth does a Lexus cost more than a Toyota?

I am not a luxury car guy, but I understand there exist men who value marketing and branding.

"Funny thing about the ""hybrid cooling fan motor service"": in six and a half year of running Toyota hybrid company cars I've never had the dealership trying to ""upsell"" me this service. I first learned it's a thing on this sub so I asked them and they told me the diagnostic system will tell them if the fan needs cleaning and it's not a regular maintenance item. It's a ""service if and when needed"" item so $289 every 20000 miles sounds like a classic needless upsell.

Brake fluid: OK, it never hurts replacing it regularly. 

EFI service. The A25 has dual injection: both direct and port. This complex system is designed precisely to reduce the frequence of intake cleaning due to carbon buildup caused by GDI (Volkswagen and Toyota play catch with each other often: this is a classic case). ""Recommended every 30000 miles"" is another upsell: even on engines that run exclusive on GDI, without port injection, the intake tract is walnut blasted or otherwise professionally cleaned every 80000/100000km but most owners just bother when their cars start suffering ill effects (usually random misfires).

So, yes: it's definitely a shakedown. 

No need to find another place: just tell them to stick to the maintenance written in your owner's handbook. There's enough beside an oil change to keep food on their table. As usual with hybrids it's very important to get a hybrid system health report (part of every service) and to check if there are updates for the car electronics. These two details are, in my opinion, worth far more than any oil change.

More subtle: Toyota releases dozens of Technical Service bulletins (TSB) every quarter for their cars. These are effectively ""stealth recalls"" and only cars serviced at a dealership or by an officially authorized independent have access to them.",0.18226817,0.6328805,0.18485141

"&gt;Your original post was really kind of just a cesspool of poorly informed talking points. The fuck do PPP funds and stimulus money have to do with anything? People need cars in North America, spending your money on cars is squarely reasonable.

The point was that there was a sudden infusion of funds. Sorry, I thought that was obvious. People buying cars all of a sudden had a higher down payment and access to low interest loans. People in the market for $20-$30k cars all of a sudden could ""afford"" $40k+ cars. 

The EV credit had the same immediate impact - and you were able to see the prices shift in real time. When the EV credit expired for the EV Bolt, prices dropped to compete against cars that still has the credit. Model Y had a huge drop in price as well a couple months ago. 

2020 - 2022 had prices far above the normal due to shortages, random cash infusions, and low interest rates. In 2023, there are no expected cash infusions and interest rates are much higher. With threats of a recession, are you really serious in believing that spending for cars will continue to increase in the immediate future? I expect the reverse. I expect that dealerships will try to live in the peak 2020-2022 phase as long as they could. I expect that when they discover it is not sustainable, things will start coming back down again - things will start sitting on lots. 

&gt;Most people don‚Äôt even know the bZ4X ever existed. It‚Äôs not going to be a long term problem for them. They are not only investing in hydrogen, they are a massive company that spends money on all kinds of R&amp;D.

Where do you even get that? lol. As interest in EV skyrocketed in the past couple years, so has interest in a Toyota EV. The bZ4X was introduced near the tailend of the pandemic and was presold out everywhere since it qualified for the EV credit at the time. People have been waiting for a Toyota EV because of their reputation in hybrids. It is not unknown amongst those looking for an EV. 

But after the recall, and the lost of credit, bZ4X are sitting on lots. 

It is speculated that Akio Toyoda was ""promoted"" to make way for Koji Sato so he can push and focus on EVs.

Edit: Typos

Also, I'm not really quite sure what your point is. Are you just fanboing Toyota and they can do and say no wrong? Like, I love Toyota - it's why I'm here. But I'm not blind to their shortcomings. 

Nothing I said is really controversial. Prices for cars went up as access to money went up. Access to money has been reduced, and it should be expected that prices for cars will scale accordingly. Toyota EVs have so far been a failure, and the main resistence to developing EVs were to focus on their Hydrogen platform. The GR Corolla is literally a byproduct that development (which is great for us), but it still highlights that they ""gambled"" on Hydrogen vs EV and while they did not ""lose"" (I think there is definitely room for Fuel Cell EV in our future), they're definitely not winning anything. Even Toyota acknowledges their shortcomings with regards to EVs.

The only reason I even brought up EVs to begin with is to highlight the fact that Toyota is not infallible - that we'll be paying 50,000 on average soon is basically wishful thinking.",0.3663173,0.5764805,0.05720216
"Exactly.... Too many Rolex swiss watch snobs haven't actually taken the time to read about Grand Seiko. I say this because my in father in law is one of them:) my wife and her dad's family, bless them all dearly, have been fortunate enough to all be able to wear a swiss watch from Longines, to Omega to Tag and my wife's dad wears a Rolex. 

I've looked at a Rolex watch, and it does not stir my soul the way a Grand Seiko does. 

So the time came time to choosing my watch, they are currently trying to pick and suggest a Mont Blanc as a semi inexpensive swiss watch for me. Sure it's nice, I then mentioned Grand Seiko, and the blood drained from their faces... Quite funny actually... They still think, like most people that it's just a Seiko.... Yet they drive a Toyota landcruiser and still fully appreciate that Lexus is Toyotas luxury arm... (SEIKO is to GS as Toyota is to Lexus)

Crime/Vandalism: Crime and vandalism exist but it isn't so bad that your car would randomly get broken into in most neighborhoods. As for parking garages, as long as your car is fairly empty and you have no backpacks/purses/bags in plain sight (unless you drive a model 3 Tesla) they will move pass your car.

Car theft, if your car is known to be easy to steal (a lot of base trim older trucks and KIAs w/o immobilizer) or is a rare car, you should be more than fine. I have parked my Subaru and Toyota outdoor for years all over town without any issues. 

Safety: I would say around SJSU is pretty safe. I have friends who live in downtown and we have walked home from the bar plenty of times. As long as you pay attention to your surrounding and trust your instinct. If you don't feel safe or feel something is off, go into a store or whatever is open and call an Uber/Lyft to get home. Try not to walk by yourself in areas that you're not familiar with after dark. If anything, just do exactly what you would do in Fresno and you'll be fine.

COL: I would say the biggest COL is obviously rent which can eat a ton of your budget. For the price of renting a room in a house here, you could get a whole apartment in northeast Fresno. Food wise, you should expect on average everything about 15-20% more than Fresno but I think once you're familiar with the area, you'll start to know where to go to get good eats for affordable prices.

"Ooof, literally wrote my grad thesis on the subject (Well, legal and economic game theory of drug IP in general, not vaccines specifically), and work in health policy, so I‚Äôm the wrong person to come to for a simple/straightforward answer on this one! 

At a vastly oversimplified level, it‚Äôs mostly about the inherent structural capacity and reliability of the oversight functions of *any* country without a robust ‚Äúpharma‚Äù industry already in place (bc ‚Äúpharma‚Äù isn‚Äôt really one thing, but many very different streams, all of which have their own degrees of difficulty and highly specialized safety and quality testing needs). 

Generic small molecule drugs - whether those are produced bc a patent expired or bc a company was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to share IP because of the extent and impact of the unmet need in low income countries - are *relatively* easy to manufacture and quality check, so that cuts the risk down to reasonably acceptable levels in most instances. 

Also, the fundamental concept of ‚Äúgeneric drugs‚Äù is well understood by the general public, so if something *were* to go wrong (god forbid, knock wood), the impacts and popular understanding of the problem would be akin to a design flaw/recall of a particular model of specific brand of car. 

Vaccines - along w blood products, and even some biologics, although to a lesser extent - are a completely different ballgame. The current production capacity for those products is *much* more limited, largely bc relatively lower market demand/volumes for these more ‚Äúspecialized‚Äù area haven‚Äôt created a compelling economic or policy incentive for investment in those capacities. COVID has likely shifted those dynamics, but any new manufacturing that sprouts up will take years to get staffed and running properly, bc you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúretrofit‚Äù a generic antibiotics producer into a vaccine facility, and will basically have to start from scratch. 

Beyond the practical constraints/risks, there‚Äôs the very different public understanding and perceptions of vaccines especially. Up until like 2 years ago I couldn‚Äôt have even told you what brands of vaccines I‚Äôd ever gotten (and that‚Äôs a someone who specializes in this kind of stuff). Obviously COVID changed that, and some folks have  *started* distinguishing between Pfizer vs Moderna, etc‚Ä¶but by and large, it‚Äôs still about ‚Äúthe vaccine‚Äù for a given disease. Meaning if ANY vaccine manufacturer drops the ball, the understanding will look less like the reaction to a recall of 2022 Toyotas 4Runners (or whatever) and more like industry wide alert of a potentially fatal design flaw in all cars and trucks.

"After working on a bunch of different makes and models throughout the years, my experience has been that American cars tend to just... Break.  A lot.  In expensive ways.  All cars can do this of course, but I've personally seen it significantly less in Japanese cars.  My last car, an 08 Mazda 3, I got it with 78k and sold at 130k miles.  I replaced the alternator at one point, but besides that never had any issues whatsoever.  When I sold it, I even threw it on a lift for the buyer to see everything and there was absolutely nothing - no leaks, torn boots or bushings, etc.  I haven't ever seen an American car at that age or mileage without a bunch of leaks and issues, even when taken care of well.  Plus, Buicks aren't exactly known for reliability.

&amp;#x200B;

Also... after the Mazda, I got into a 2012 Mazdaspeed 3, same platform but the performance variant, actually right around August as well.  It had no issues and I go it at 98k miles.

"You're inadvertently arguing against capitalism, the privatization of infrastructure construction and most importantly, American car culture and the Automotive lobby.  

But hey, you gave a source.  It's just a news article and not an actual research piece, but let's use it.  Because, let's be honest, you haven't actually *read* it.  Because if you had, you wouldn't have linked it.  

&gt; As transit researcher Alon Levy writes in a report for the Niskanen Center, ‚ÄúThis is not about our wealth: there is no correlation between a country‚Äôs GDP per capita and its subway construction costs. Nor is it about geological factors: the biggest factor behind a project‚Äôs cost is what country it is in, and costs are fairly consistent even across different geologies ... This is purely institutional.‚Äù  

&gt; And when it comes to roads and the bulk of the high costs ‚Äî ‚Äúthe new construction bit‚Äù ‚Äî Turner says even though he has ‚Äúno idea why those prices are increasing,‚Äù he can ‚Äúeliminate a lot of things.‚Äù Turner explains that common theories like unions or the way we‚Äôre building roads or where we‚Äôre building them (for example, in more urban areas) are not supported by statistical evidence.  

So what's the problem?

&gt; As the Action Committee for Transit, a local pro-transit organization, documented, residents of the wealthy DC suburb of Chevy Chase have led a decades-long crusade against the light rail project, which will benefit the entire region, by claiming that a ‚Äútiny transparent invertebrate‚Äù might be at risk. ‚ÄúWhen no endangered amphipods were found,‚Äù the detractors turned to other arguments. However, repeated references to the potential harm to the Columbia Country Club and also a public comment disparaging the needs of people in less affluent communities makes clear that much of the stated concern was likely never environmental or financial.  

Public rail projects are a threat to American car culture, who employ *lobbyists* to ensure that these projects never get built, or get constantly delayed which causes cost overruns.  

https://readpassage.com/lesson/the-invention-of-car-culture/  

&gt; Many popular accounts of this history focus on the mid-20th century story of National City Lines, a consortium made up of General Motors, Standard Oil of California and Firestone Tires that bought up streetcar lines in cities across the U.S. and converted most systems to buses. (These companies were convicted of violating antitrust legislation in 1949). 

&gt; But the lobbying power of the automobile industry long predates the alleged conspiracy. As University of Virginia historian Peter Norton chronicled in his 2011 book Fighting Traffic, the newly emerging industry fought incredibly hard to reconstitute cities as car-dominated geographies. Those efforts included literally inventing the concept of ‚Äújaywalking‚Äù and organizing opposition against attempts to enforce speed limits.

&gt; **The automobile industry was intimately involved with the massive postwar expansion of highways and suburban development**, a subject that we‚Äôll dive into more in the next newsletter. Throughout this unprecedented social reorganization, these companies continued to do what they do best: attack critics like Ralph Nader; ignore known defects, such as with the Ford Pinto and various Toyota models; evade environmental regulations, like during the Volkswagen emissions scandal.  

And then, once they raised taxes to build these road projects, people in the government beholden to the automotive industry cut taxes (gee, I wonder which party that is) to ensure there would be no funding for public rail, while the automotive lobbyists continued working against them in other ways.  

And here, you continue arguing for them, doing the job of the lobbyists for them.

"Well since im from Germany, i can give you my perspective on how we view our cars.

First off, no, not every German drives a German car and yes, it has always been that way. Especially the market for more affordable cars, lets say below 30.000‚Ç¨ has always been highly competitive. Renault, Citroen, Peugeot, Ford, Opel, Toyota, Kia, Hyundai, Fiat, Honda, Dacia, Seat, Skoda (tho Seat and Skoda they sell cars based off VWs) and so on. When it comes to people who just want a car, theyre likely not to go for a german car because few german car manufacturers actually compete in that market.

So how do germans see the reliability of a german car? Somewhere in the middle but its also not that important of an aspect for many people. Generally speaking, most people see the reliability of a car in the hands of the owner. Do you treat your car and engine well? Do you service your car in the manufacturers recommended interval? If you treat your modern car like youre supposed to, it will last, almost regardless from which brand. 

When it comes to the luxury brands, the German market is pretty much exclusive to the German brands. However in the luxury segment, the same can be said all around the globe (talking 50-150k in price), the German brands simply have little competition. And i know what youre going to say: 'but Lexus', yeah Lexus is not relevant here. There are competitors in certain regions like Lexus in the US but Lexus simply isnt as popular around the world. One last point id like to make is that these luxurious brands were talking about, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, they sell cars with powerful and complicated engines, with a lot of features and equipment that cheaper cars dont have. Naturally there is more to break and somebody who buys a BMW presses the throttle a little harder than somebody who buys a Toyota and just wants to drive somewhere without having a closer relationship with his car.

No matter how well you inspect a new car, if it's made of low-quality materials, nothing good will come of it. I keep thinking about my 100% Korean Kia Rio (indestructible car, a hatchback from 2009).  
  
In this car, many problems appeared later. First, the gas pedal started to creak, then the plastic showed how cheap it was. Is the paint peeling off due to the wind? Maybe... Anyway, no matter how good the car looked initially, if it has such materials, what will happen to it in 5 years?  
  
Initially, I wanted to take a Toyota Camry, but they gave me a 21% interest rate. They said it was because I was new to the country (almost 2 years at the moment) and had no credit history. A few months later, I found a cosigner, but it was too late (a very kind and responsive person, he vouched for us even though we weren't really familiar). There were no cars on the market, and the person was waiting. When I came to Kia, there was only 1 car, there was nothing to choose from. As a result, I got an 8.4% interest rate (which is also high by American standards). Basically, I took what was there, it looked good overall, even great.  


  
If only I had known that America assembles such poor quality cars... I wouldn't have bought a car for anything, even if the cosigner had left, but I would have waited for a 100% Korean car (although I'm not sure if they even exist now).

"I have been watching a lot of the car care nut youtube channel.  He is a master toyota tech.  He says these are actually money pits if they are not taken care of, especially the higher models with air ride.  As long as it has been serviced well, people report getting 300-400k+ miles on them.

The LS 400 is the one he says is bulletproof.  The LS 430 is also good, but the 460 can be trouble or it can be really good.  I guess it all depends.

This is based on what I've found so far.  I think they are really reliable in general, its just that a few things are common to fail (water pump, brake actuator, suspension) and get very costly when they do. Of course, a mechanic is biased as they only see the problem vehicles, not the 10s of thousands of trouble-free ones.

Thats my 2 cents I guess lol  I am also holding hope that I didn't invest into a problem car since I don't have air ride, it was serviced a lot, and some of the trouble points have been addressed already. lol

"VTEC (Variable Valve Timing &amp; Lift Electronic Control) is a system developed by Honda to improve the volumetric efficiency of a four-stroke internal combustion engine, resulting in higher performance at high RPM, and lower fuel consumption at low RPM. The VTEC system uses two (or occasionally three) camshaft profiles and hydraulically selects between profiles. It was invented by Honda engineer Ikuo Kajitani. It is distinctly different from standard VVT (variable valve timing) systems which change only the valve timings and do not change the camshaft profile or valve lift in any way. Japan levies a tax based on engine displacement, and Japanese auto manufacturers have correspondingly focused their research and development efforts toward improving the performance of their smaller engine designs. One method for increasing performance into a static displacement includes forced induction, as with models such as the Toyota Supra and Nissan 300ZX which used turbocharger applications and the Toyota MR2 which used a supercharger for some model years. Another approach is the rotary engine used in the Mazda RX-7 and RX-8. A third option is to change the cam timing profile, of which Honda VTEC was the first successful commercial design for altering the profile in real-time. The VTEC system provides the engine with valve timing optimized for both low and high RPM operations. In basic form, the single cam lobe and follower/rocker arm of a conventional engine is replaced with a locking multi-part rocker arm and two cam profiles: one optimized for low-RPM stability and fuel efficiency, and the other designed to maximize high-RPM power output. The switching operation between the two cam lobes is controlled by the ECU which takes account of engine oil pressure, engine temperature, vehicle speed, engine speed and throttle position. Using these inputs, the ECU is programmed to switch from the low lift to the high lift cam lobes when certain conditions are met. At the switch point a solenoid is actuated that allows oil pressure from a spool valve to operate a locking pin which binds the high RPM rocker arm to the low RPM ones. From this point on, the valves open and close according to the high-lift profile, which opens the valve further and for a longer time. The switch-over point is variable, between a minimum and maximum point, and is determined by engine load. The switch-down back from high to low RPM cams is set to occur at a lower engine speed than the switch-up (representing a hysteretic cycle) to avoid a situation in which the engine is asked to operate continuously at or around the switch-over point.
The older approach to timing adjustments is to produce a camshaft with a valve timing profile that is better suited to low-RPM operation. The improvements in low-RPM performance, which is where most street-driven automobiles operate a majority of the time, occur in trade for a power and efficiency loss at higher RPM ranges. Correspondingly, VTEC attempts to combine low-RPM fuel efficiency and stability with high-RPM performance. VTEC, the original Honda variable valve control system, originated from REV (Revolution-Modulated Valve Control) introduced on the CBR400 in 1983 known as HYPER VTEC. In the regular four-stroke automobile engine, the intake and exhaust valves are actuated by lobes on a camshaft. The shape of the lobes determines the timing, lift and duration of each valve. Timing refers to an angle measurement of when a valve is opened or closed with respect to the piston position (BTDC or ATDC). Lift refers to how much the valve is opened. Duration refers to how long the valve is kept open. Due to the behavior of the working fluid (air and fuel mixture) before and after combustion, which have physical limitations on their flow, as well as their interaction with the ignition spark, the optimal valve timing, lift and duration settings under low RPM engine operations are very different from those under high RPM. Optimal low RPM valve timing lift and duration settings would result in insufficient filling of the cylinder with fuel and air at high RPM, thus greatly limiting engine power output. Conversely, optimal high RPM valve timing lift and duration settings would result in very rough low RPM operation and difficult idling. The ideal engine would have fully variable valve timing, lift and duration, in which the valves would always open at exactly the right point, lift high enough and stay open just the right amount of time for the engine speed and load in use. VTEC was introduced as a DOHC (dual overhead camshaft) system in Japan in the 1989 Honda Integra XSi, which used the 160¬†bhp (120¬†kW) B16A engine. The same year, Europe saw the arrival of VTEC in the Honda Civic and Honda CRX 1.6i-VT, using a 150¬†bhp (110¬†kW) B16A1 variant. The United States market saw its first VTEC system with the introduction of the 1991 Acura NSX, which used a 3-litre DOHC C30A V6 with 270¬†bhp (200¬†kW). DOHC VTEC engines soon appeared in other vehicles, such as the 1992 Acura Integra GS-R (160¬†bhp (120¬†kW)B17A1), and later in the 1993 Honda Prelude VTEC (195¬†bhp (145¬†kW) H22A) and Honda Del Sol VTEC (160¬†bhp (120¬†kW) B16A3). The Integra Type R (1995‚Äì2000) available in the Japanese market produces 197¬†bhp (147¬†kW; 200¬†PS) using a B18C 1.8-litre engine, producing more horsepower per litre than most super-cars at the time. Honda has also continued to develop other varieties and today offers several varieties of VTEC, such as i-VTEC and i-VTEC Hybrid. Honda also applied the system to SOHC (single overhead camshaft) engines such as the D-Series and J-Series Engines, which share a common camshaft for both intake and exhaust valves. The trade-off was that Honda's SOHC engines benefited from the VTEC mechanism only on the intake valves. This is because VTEC requires a third center rocker arm and cam lobe (for each intake and exhaust side), and, in the SOHC engine, the spark plugs are situated between the two exhaust rocker arms, leaving no room for the VTEC rocker arm.

"Plug-in hybrid tho, if you can recharge the battery like daily then yes good choice. If you are as lazy as me and won't recharge daily then no, conventional hybrid or gas only is the better choice. Not charging a plug-in hybrid is worse than a gas only car because you paid extra for the electric motor systems and it add weights and complexity. 

And for that cash you have, you're pretty much looking at Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mazda3, (and maybe Nissan for even lower cost?). And don't take loans unless you really want something better, the interest rate right now is pretty high in my opinion. 

Toyota has a better reputation for reliability, so less worry about part failures; Honda has bigger interior spaces so you and you friends/family can sit more comfortably in the car; Mazda has a little more ""luxurious"" interior and a bit more power.

"First of all my standards are not low and yes i am happy with the game. I voiced my initial dissatisfaction about things that bothered me like most ppl, the missing crafting for example.  
Now 5 month after launch X patches later the game is in a very good state, everything promised is implemented. They clearly stated and may it be in a questionable way, that attachments were scrapped. Now ppl still complain about a dev team working to make their game BETTER and clearly making progress doing it.   
It is not the problem of the devs that ppl got so hyped and had so high expectations even after a free accessible beta which showed what you would get and its not like there were no reviews about the game before launch which were also not good to put it nicely, but still ppl expected a triple A quality game.

"Look a hate pick up trucks as much as the next person but the US is big and not all well paved. Here are some of the many reasons people have them:

- Roadtripping (gotta be able to haul that boat and/or RV trailer thingy)

- ""Off"" Roading (a lot of remote roads are made of just dirt or gravel and are not well maintained, this is why I see more pick ups in the southwestern US than I ever did in NY)

- Hobbies (you like woodwork, you gotta be able to move all of that lumber from Home Depot)

- Landscaping! (Pretty much speaks for itself, a lot of big equipment)

- I want to feel manly (not a good reason, but common, also not a valid enough reason to be blinding me with your frickin headlights)

"The times are to look at in the end of the smoke so you know how worth it that brisket is. Not for cookin. 

Now before you even start smokin, trim that bugger up real aerodynamic. No thin corners and try to get that fat off the point. After that its all preference. Then, I like to inject with either tallow or butter. It isnt necessary at all but it makes it like a toyota. Idiot proof. Exactly what I need cause there will be hooch when smokin a brisket. 

For the first segment, its bark time. Get you your rub of choice on that bad boy, throw it on your smoker at 225-250 and do not open it for at least an hour and a half. The only thing you care about in this portion is thin blue smoke and smoker temp. I use a yummly bluetooth probe which tells me the ambient smoker temp and I highly recommend something similar. Its been a total game changer. 

Pop it open every hour and a half to check the bark. The way I check is I poke the outside and if the bark stays on the meat and my finger stays clean, its time to wrap. 

Now I love butcher paper and I love tallow. So I'll wrap mine 2 times in butcher paper with some tallow and then wrap it up in a tight tight tight layer of foil. That will keep the bark set and make sure it doesnt look funky at the end. Remember to take the temp probe out before wrapping and reinsert it into the outside through the foil. Foil covering the end will mess with ambient temps and internal temps of the meat. 

Get it back on the smoker till it reaches 195 and probe for tenderness. Check every now and again in both flat and point for that room temp butter feeling, and when you get there pull it off the pit. 

Rest that bad boy for at least 2 hours in a cooler, more if you want. I love resting mine for 6-8 because after I finish a brisket its usually time for bed.

"None of that tracks with what I've been told, or what I know about the line up.


The NA 2.5 4 pot hybrid uses electric motors and a CVT that would make sense on a unibody pickup like the rumoured Stout. Unless Toyota decided to completely destroy what makes their best selling, golden goose what it is, a direct drive hybrid setup like the traditional hybrids use is nonsense and it will alienate very single Toyota truck buyer. That powerplant would be perfect in a small unibody Maverick fighter, but awful in a real truck.

I can't see the V6 carrying over when Toyota is actively killing the GR series engine. It went away in Highlander. It probably goes away in Camry and IS very soon. It definitely isn't long for this world in 4Runner. Keeping it alive when the T24A is a better, more efficient powerplant flies in the face of Toyota's global plan of maximum modularity with minimal pieces. Part of the TNGA platform is supposed to be fewer engines that fit in more cars. Keeping the 2GR alive because truck people like it isn't something Toyota cares about. If they did, the V35A wouldn't exist, and we'd still be complaining about the 2UR's fuel economy 

Lastly the current lifespan of the new turbo T24A seems to make it make sense in the other cars it's been dropped into. Toyota North America's reputation is directly tied to Tacoma's. Using the current Highlander and NX as a test bed for the real home for that engine - the Taco - lines up exactly with what happened with Tundra. The V35A was quietly plunked into the LS for a couple years before its big Tundra debut.

"Okay I dove into the owners manual and it said nothing lol. But I found what I was looking for in the ‚Äúwarranty &amp; maintenance guide‚Äù page 54. 

‚ÄúEngine Oil and Oil Filter:
Replace the oil filter and drain and refill the engine oil at specified intervals. For recommended oil grade and viscosity, refer to the Owner's Manual.
NOTE: Your vehicle is factory filled and certified with Genuine Toyota OW20 motor oil. For VEHICLES CERTIFIED FOR OW20 motor oil, the oil change interval is 10,000 miles or 12 months IF OW20 MOTOR OIL IS BEING USED. If OW20 is not available, 5W20 mineral oil may be used. However, it must be replaced at A 5,000 miles or 6 month INTERVAL with OW20 motor oil.
For customers who primarily drive their vehicle under any of the listed Special Operating Conditions, the motor oil and filter should be replaced at 5,000 miles or 6 months, REGARDLESS OF THE OIL USED (OR CERTIFICATION OF THE VEHICLE).‚Äù  I then couldn‚Äôt find for the life of me what Toyota defines as ‚Äúspecial operating conditions‚Äù. So I searched it up and found this bulletin that said;

Oil, viscosity, and applicability and change interval guide: Tech Tips S-TT-0073-13

Starting with the 2011 model year, Scion began a gradual transition to the use of synthetic Ow-20 viscosity engine oil. There are multiple benefits of this oil, including:
‚Ä¢ Reduced friction and wear on engine surfaces
‚Ä¢ Im proved fuel economy
‚Ä¢ Reduction in waste oil stream (in vehicles approved for 10,000 mile oil change intervals)
‚Ä¢ Reduced maintenance cost (in vehicles approved for 10,000 mile oil change intervals)

Due to the improved performance and durability of Ow-20 synthetic oil, Scion has extended the oil change intervals to 10,000 miles for vehicles that require this oil (except for FR-S). With this change, the following should be noted:
‚Ä¢ Only Scion vehicles in which Ow-20 oil is mandatory have been approved for extended oil change intervals
‚Ä¢ Vehicles in which Ow-20 is an option to 5w-20 (or 5w-30) will continue to require 5,000 mile change intervals, even if Ow-20 oil is used
‚Ä¢ In the case of vehicles with 10,000 mile oil change intervals, the 5,000 mile service interval has not been eliminated . The traditional 5,000 mile maintenance procedures (such as tire rotation) will continue to be required, and the fluid levels (including engine oil) will need to be checked and adjusted at this time
‚Ä¢ If the vehicle operation meets the standard criteria for ""Special Operating Conditions"" such as: driving off-road, on dirt roads, towing a trailer, making repeated short trips under 32¬∞ F, or extensive idling; the engine oil must be replaced at 5,000 mile intervals, regardless of oil used. Exception is FR-S, where the oil must be replaced every 3,750 miles, under ""Special Operating Conditions.""

"The Dynamic Force internal combustion engines are designed to use as many common components as possible, from the I3 M15 to the V6 V35. This includes the EGR valve asembly, which includes the cooler.

There have been many cases of EGR cooler failure at low mileage on DF engines. basically the heat exchanger succumbs to corrosion, coolant enters the EGR gas channels and from there the cylinders. The typical symptoms are white smoke from the exhaust but perfect cylinder compression and no oil consumption. If the problem is ignored it will escalate quickly: loss of power, the EGR valve itself will become saturated with crystal deposits from the evaporated coolant and stop working (throwing P319000 and P04019C) and if coolant is allowed to drop too low the engine will overheat... you get the picture.

If you live in Japan or in the US, no big deal: Toyota will cover it under warranty. ""It's just a defective part sir, we don't know how it slipped through QC. We are sorry for the inconvenience"". In Europe Toyota has been refusing to honor warranties and it started blaming customers for using ""chlorine contaminated gasoline"". Which makes absolutely zero sense. First, while gasoline in many European countries is pretty low quality there are many many 2ZR-FXE engines in Prius and Auris Hybrid taxis that accumulated literally hundreds of thousand km with zero corrosion problems to the EGR cooler. Second, how are customers supposed to actively avoid ""chlorine contaminated gasoline""? Should they carry a mass spectrometer on the back seat? And why are EGR coolers installed on Mercedes or other brands completely unaffected? Toyota is looking like a fool here and burning a lot of goodwill, literally to save pennies.  

Toyota's most problematic engine ever, the notorious 1VD-FTV, owed many of its catastrophic defects to Toyota cutting corners to increase margins by using inferior materials.

Husband and I are 24, we take home after taxes, health insurance, and 15% retirement around $8,000 a month.

We save about 1/2 of our income or more. Minimum 1/2, sometimes 5k a month. We live rent free for now. 

Husband and I share a car. Getting real sick of it and need one by the summer for my extra summer job.

We have around 78k in savings (in a high yield savings account, getting around $2-300 a month in interest). 

We are wanting to buy a house in the near future (around a year or so, housing market is crazy right now with high prices and high interest rates, going to wait and see what happens.) 

Used cars are ridiculously expensive right now still.

We have good credit 800s. 

I could either buy a used Toyota or a new one. Looking to buy a new Corolla 25k OTD with fees and taxes. 

I can get a 4% interest rate, put 10k down, 48 month loan and it‚Äôs around $330 a month. Been in contact with a Toyota dealer. They don‚Äôt do markups (and I double checked and asked friends who bought from them). Just gotta reserve a Corolla rn for it to come this summer. 

Or I can just pay for it cash. 

Or, should I buy overpriced used car?

The things you're asking for aren't unreasonable, but I do see one potential conflict. It needs to be big enough to haul you and the family, luxury enough to impress clients, and new enough to have the latest tech. I think it might be difficult to get all three of these. And, though you didn't state it, you probably want it to be reliable too. **Could you possibly rank these characteristics from least to most important?**

From what you've said so far, here's my thoughts.

A used Lexus RX is an easy recommendation. It's spacious, reliable, and can be had at the price you're asking. But they'll probably be from 2017 and before, which means it probably won't have the latest tech, but you'll still get some fun luxury features.

However, for the same amount of money, you can get a new base trim Toyota Sequoia/Kia Sorento/Hyundai Santa Fe or higher-trim Toyota Rav4/Kia Sportage/Hyundai Tucson. These brands may not be as impressive, but they'll literally be brand new, with full warranties, no previous owners, and plenty of technical goodies like lane keep, radar cruise, possibly 360 cameras, and Android Auto/Apple Carplay.

"This perfectly describes my relationship with Nissan, a bittersweet one because the old Nissans from 1999 and prior were some of the greatest cars ever made even the non-enthusiast models were great because they rivaled Toyota and Honda in terms of reliability but once the 2000's hit that was the beginning of the end for Nissan as it was and should return to, granted it was out of necessity since Nissan was a dying brand at the time with them going through the 90's struggling to make a profit on anything, yes Carlos saved Nissan from the grave but at what cost?  The reputation of a titan in the Japanese car industry and to be honest I would've rather seen Nissan die with a bang and an amazing legacy that everyone would remember fondly of instead of the brand that lost its way and lived in infamy for 2 decades and Nissan is right back where they were 2 decades ago, struggling to make a profit but this time they also have to reverse a decades old bad reputation of poorly made cars that start falling apart if you look at it funny. I currently own a B17 (2013-2019) Sentra 1.8, and the only reason why I got it was because it has a 6-speed and the Toyota I wanted was sold the day before I went to look at it and the B17 is OK at best but the whole car just feels flimsy for the most part and it breaks my heart to see the brand I loved as a child, the same brand that made the R32 GTR be reduced to a brand that make rental cars and some outdated sports cars on the side, yes I know the Z got updated for 2022 but it uses the same platform and a lot of old parts from the 370, I'm still holding on to faith that one day the real Nissan will come back but it's getting harder and harder to justify this belief.  I know it's kinda stupid, but I want to be optimistic. I want to see it become a reality for Nissan to make some legendary cars that anyone in my generation can afford and reclaim their title as one of the greatest Japanese car manufacturers ever, but will it happen time will tell but my optimism only goes so far and I won't be surprised if it doesn't and we'll be stuck with Renault-Nissan or Nissan will be gone by 2030 dying with a whimper instead of dying with one big explosion of greatness in the 2000's and with that I leave you with this English essay on my relationship with Nissan and my hopes for a brighter future for this once great brand in a tunnel filled with darkness.

Despite your personal opinion, current times in the US, $4,800 is not stupid high for an old Toyota, its just stupid high compared to different times and different places in the world. I‚Äôve seen Toyotas in lesser condition and more miles sell for more than that here. If you pay attention to the market, the price of a vehicle really has nothing to do with the actual value of the vehicle, rather what someone is willing to pay for it, and people are willing to pay a lot for used vehicles right now, much more for used Toyotas because they‚Äôre solid vehicles, but really all vehicle prices are severely inflated right now.

Battery packs are too expensive and will drive the price of EVs too high. And there is no way to make it cheaper if the batteries are bought from third parties.

I think some will survive, but most brands will go bankrupt.

F-150 w/ 5.0 V8 would be my second, or first if you're in the full sized market exclusively.

Tundra is a first model year, so that's highly inadvisable. If you can wait another year, I'm sure a lot of the kinks will be sorted out.

Ram has the 5.7l which is old tech but suffers from ""Stellantis build quality issues"" and the 5.7l is really only a 200k mile max engine before the AFM starts causing issues. Weak transmissions have also been a Ram thing for a long time. Stay the hell away from the ecodiesel. The 3.6l is a 500k motor (or at least there's examples of it) but it's super underpowered for the truck.

The Silverado/Sierra have major AFM lifter issues and I personally know 3 people who have had their lifters fail within 10k miles. Also the transmissions have a lot of TSBs about poor performance. Honestly, the 2.7l turbo is proving to be more reliable. I got to drive a 3.0 Duramax and it was slow as hell.

The only major issue I'm aware of with the Nissan Titan is catalytic converters breaking down and getting sucked back into the engine. It's pretty uncommon but typically happens at the 80k mile mark.

If it's a private seller you will have less protection and no warranty. Plus, for a ¬£10k car some people probably won't let you test drive it unless you get temp insurance cover - i believe ¬£25 per day. I think AA ¬£200 used car check would be good for you so you can look nationally and not be limited by location (cars in north are usually cheaper but watch out for rust). If AA finds any faults you could always knock down by ¬£200 which cancels out the AA check cost. As a final check use vcheck to check the car isn't stolen or have outstanding finance. If the car is all good then go up there to collect it. Plus, Toyota currently do a Toyota Relax program where if it's under 10 years old/100k miles, if you service the car with them they'll give you 1 years warranty. Not sure if this covers the GT86 too.  


On the other hand if it's a dealer you will have more protection and warranty, but pay a premium. Just make sure it's a reputable dealer by looking at the reviews. If it's a bad dealer they will give you a headache and you will have to go to court. Usually if there are any issues within 6 months the garage will have to fix it.

"It's because America is very large with a low population density. The country is connected by roads that are 70 mph - 85 mph (113km/h to 136km/h). The majority of the country has highway roads that are 55 mph - 65 mph (89 km/h to 105km/h) where you have to pass in the opposing traffic lane. 

Also, all of these roads have people driving the speed limit with trailers. This is why Americans don't have small vehicles pulling trailers like Europe. Our trailers have the axle farther back with more weight on the vehicle to have better high speed stability. 

With that said, I'm not saying the vehicle isn't safe to drive or anything. Just that this type of acceleration is very poor for a vehicle that is starting in the mid-50s and likely can't get out of the door for under $70k. I'm sure you paid less for your Golf, right?

"So it seems there are quite a few folks who are quick to judge the towing capacity and weight ratings of this setup just by looking at the picture. After hearing all of the negative comments I‚Äôll have to admit, I was beginning to wonder if I was in fact an ‚Äúidiot‚Äù. 
How about we break down the stats!
All of these specs were pulled from Toyota.com using this vehicles specific VIN. The camper specs were pulled from the manufacturer website.

Toyota
Curb weight (weight of vehicle without payload) 
- 4,508lb
GVWR (the max weight, vehicle plus payload, this vehicle can hold)
- 6,000lb

GCVWR (the max combined weight, vehicle plus payload plus camper, that can be towed)
- 9,940lb

Payload (max amount of weight of stuff you can put in the vehicke)
- 1,492lb

Towing Capacity (max amount of weight that can be safely towed)
- 5,000lb

Now let‚Äôs look at the camper ratings

Cub camper

UVW (unloaded vehicle weight, the weight of the camper empty, usually doesn‚Äôt include weight of propane tanks and batteries)
- 3,400lb

GVWR ( max weight of camper plus payload)
- 4,840lb

Hitch weight or tongue weight (weight of camper measured at the hitch point)
Now the manufacturer specs say 231lb but that is based on the UVW and since I haven‚Äôt personally weighed it I used 300lb as my number.

So now that we have all these weights let‚Äôs see how they breakdown. First let‚Äôs figure out our estimated payload for the Highlander. (Passengers + cargo + hitch weight)

We will have 2 adults and 2 kids in the vehicle at most.
Our combined weight is 575lb
Since most of our cargo will be stored in the camper I used a weight of 100lb for additional cargo load in the vehicle. We know the hitch weight is 300lb est 

Total vehicle estimated payload of 975lb
This leaves us with an available payload of 517lb
Payload rating 1,492 - 975 = available payload of +517lb

This takes us to figuring out our new GVW or gross vehicle weight.
Curb weight (4508)+ estimated payload (975) = 5,483
So our total vehicle weight or GVW is 5,483lb which is under the 6,000lb limit.

Now let‚Äôs combine this with the camper to get our new GCVW or gross combined vehicle weight.

So if we used the GVWR of the camper, meaning the max weight of this camper PLUS cargo in the camper, that would be 4,840lb. Add this to the GVW of the vehicle (5,483) and we get 10,323 which is OVER the vehicles GCVWR by 383lb. What this means is that I need to be mindful of the payload I‚Äôm putting in the camper. 

I have an available payload of 1,440lb (GVWR - UVW) take that minus the 383lb I‚Äôm over and you get 
1,057lb. This is the absolute max I can load up with cargo.

So‚Ä¶
Available vehicle payload 517lb ‚úîÔ∏è
New GVW 5,483 ‚úîÔ∏è
New GCVW 10,323 ‚ùå

Total load 10,323 - GCVWR 9,940 = over by 323lb
Available camper payload 1,440 - 323lb over = 1,117

The absolute max cargo weight I can load into this camper is 1,117lb. Since maxing out anything is a bad idea let‚Äôs Take away 25% and you get 837lb.

This means I can‚Äôt haul full water tanks etc. I need to be very mindful of what I‚Äôm loading the camper with.
So while I am right at that tipping point, in no way am I way over any of the weight ratings of my vehicle or my camper. Is it a heavy load for the Highlander, yes. Will put strain on the Highlander, yes. Am I unsafe, absolutely not. 

I hope this helps any future redditors who are searching for the same things I was when trying to figure out exactly how all these numbers work together and if their vehicle is safe to tow their trailer.

"Truck beds aren't shrinking. If anything they've stayed pretty much the same while the rest of the features on trucks have gotten larger. Trucks with smaller beds often have smaller beds because someone (*who are probably the kind of people you're referring to*) bought a brand-new truck with a crew cab, which does result in a smaller truck bed. The people who buy trucks for real work are often buying regular cab or extended cab trucks with a 6 ^1/2   or 8 foot bed.

As for vehicles continuing to get larger and larger, much of it is to accommodate features that buyers continue to request. Buyers who aren't really the type of people who want a work truck. They just want the image of being that kind of person. They want a truck with all the features and comforts of their Lincoln or other luxery car. When you cram more luxeries and features into a vehicle you start needing more space to stuff all of that shit in. Manufacturers know this, and they keep driving up prices with the addition of all of this new tech.

On top of all of this, many manufacturers took steps to kill the small truck market because they saw it as less profitable and a threat to the sales of their larger models. (Look up the chicken tax) It's only been recently that small trucks have started to be offered again, and surprise surprise, people are buying them like crazy. I've personally been looking for a smaller truck or more off-road capable vehicle, but I'm waiting for the market to get a lot better and more realistic for someone who's not ready to drop an absurd amount of money down for a truck.

I'd happily take a brand-new vehicle with less ""nice"" features in it that constantly break and the more simplistic construction like trucks used to have in the past. Especially if it meant I could get a solid vehicle that's more reliable and less expensive. Toyota is still building the Landcruiser 70s series trucks. And they're known to be borderline bombproof. But they're banned for sale in the US. You can import them, but they have to be 25 years old.

first thing you should do is figure out what car you want. if you want reliable i recommend any later model toyota. if you want something like a cuv - the toyota rav4. 20k will probably put you in the ballpark of a 2015+ toyota rav4. i recommend buying from a reputable dealerships so stick with toyota corporate dealers and not third-party dealerships. they will practically hold your hand through the process. go on toyota and find your local dealer. once you figure out which exact car you want you will ask for the VIN (vehicle id number) and provide to your insurance company and you will purchase a policy from them. i recommend geico as they are usually the cheapest in nyc for older and accident free drivers. all you need to do is go on geico.com and get a quote once you have the VIN.,0.030432336,0.6530942,0.31647354

"Absolutely there are, and I don't have an answer for that unfortunately. But to dog me just because I was lucky enough to be born into what I was born into is ridiculous in itself. Come over here you need help I have no problem helping others, I'm even getting a farm going I'm willing to give food away to those who need it. Can I help everyone in the world? No. The thing I have an issue with is the ones ""oh I don't get any help"", but REFUSE to ask for help as if they're better than it. Which from my experience and this may just be my experience and nobody else's - the ones complaining are the same who refuse any assistance.

To answer why ask, because you don't really know what people have behind closed doors or how they really feel. Maybe they don't have money to pay your rent but maybe they have a room to keep you off the streets and maybe they really care about your well being...I've been in your same spot, asked for help with rent and my mom couldn't, so next question was are you able to help provide a bed for my son at night, of which she could, and invited me to stay as well and guess what now, we worked out a deal for me to buy her house land contract with no balloon payment. No bank, no credit, no interest, just a family to family good deal the old school way. Guess how she can afford to move... My payments, guess why I have a house with no mortgage - her assistance. So what may seem on paper an unfortunate event to most actually was productive for both my mother and I. You are right that this isn't always the case but it can happen more often than thought. Modern society has everyone under the impression they need to be self made bosses and has everyone fucking their life up taking out big mortgages, big credit, big car loans. You don't need any of this shit.

I used to think all that too. Oh I have to go to college, I have to get a new car, you don't need any of that shit as long as you get a pack and stick together. I stopped chasing money years ago and instead started chasing people with a similar mindset as me.

Last but not least I'm extremely glad for my parents yes, and I look to do the same for my son as you should look to be instead of bashing those with fortunate parents.

"It's a tough one. ¬£5k doesn't get you much in this current car market. Whatever you buy will be a dice roll and you'll need to keep some money back for any repairs or things that need immediate attention. 

5k cars are usually approaching the milage point where things need sorting. Timing belt/water pump for example will need doing immediately if it hasn't already been done over the last 30k miles. It'll need a service/fluid changes if that's not been done etc. General rule for me when buying a used car is keep at least ¬£600 aside so either add or deduct that from you budget. 

It could be better the shed you know at this point... 

On the other hand this era of BMW are well known for being money pits more so as they age. Lots of parts will need changing at this mileage and more care will be needed to maintain it i.e regular oil changes. It's only going to get worse in terms or repair costs and maintenance. 

There's plenty of better cars to be had if you need something reliable. 

¬£5k will get you a Honda Civic/Accord Toyota Avensis or a Mazda 6. Infinitely more reliable, cheaper to fix and handle high miles a lot better (but more all are more prone to rust) if you can find a well cared for one with full service history it'll serve you well. 

Or you can keep saving. ¬£8k will get you a good example of most mid sized saloons/hatchbacks.

Uiteindelijk dus voor de hybride gegaan, mede door de standaard automaat optie + besparing op benzine wanneer mijn vrouw er binnen de bebouwde kom boodschappen mee gaat doen. Echter, ik ben benieuwd hoeveel ik er over zeg 7 jaar nog voor terug krijg. Al zie ik de overheid zwichten en het extra belasten en terugschroeven van bezine-auto's uitstellen tot 2035, zoals onze Oosterburen graag willen. 

Nog even gekeken naar 2-4 jaar leasen om zo een aankoop uit te stellen, echter dat loont zich niet naar mijns inziens waarbij je al snel aan de 500 euro per maand zit wil je iets groters dan een boterhammentrommel en meer dan 5000km rijden per jaar.",0.0655425,0.7256544,0.2088031

"Cornelius Police Chief David Baucom asserts that the missing persons case of 11-year-old Madalina Cojocari is ""not a cold case,"" months after her disappearance. New evidence uncovered at her family's home suggests to police that drug or human trafficking may be involved. 

 
Although she hasn't been seen since last November, police in the North Carolina town of Cornelius have yet to give up on the search for missing 11-year-old Madalina Cojocari. 

Last Tuesday, Cornelius Police Chief David Baucom asserted at a public event that Madalina's disappearance was ""not a cold case,"" according to local outlet WSOC.

""We have detectives working this case every single day,"" he said. ""We just can't talk about it. Just because we're not talking about it, doesn't mean we're not doing anything.""

The girl was last seen publicly stepping off her school bus at 4:59 p.m. on Nov. 21 of 2022 in footage obtained by the department. Madalina's mother, Diana Cojocari, said she last saw her daughter when she went to bed on Nov. 23, according to police, but the mom did not report the girl missing until Dec. 15.

Several days earlier, on Dec. 12, a counselor and resource officer from Bailey Middle School got no answer when making a welfare check at the home of the girl, who hadn't attended school since Nov. 21.

The girl's mother and stepfather, Christopher Palmiter, were indicted by a grand jury in January for failing to report the girl's disappearance to law enforcement. Now, arrest warrants obtained by WCNC indicate that police are pursuing leads related to drug and human trafficking.

Search warrants carried out on the parents' home and vehicle in mid-February indicated that drug trafficking may be involved in the girl's disappearance, according to the outlet.

A drug-sniffing dog reportedly ""alerted on the driver's side door"" of Diana Cojocari's Toyota Prius on Feb. 13. 

After her daughter was last seen and before reporting the girl's disappearance, police believe Diana may have taken a trip to Madison County, North Carolina in that Prius, and are still seeking out anyone who may have seen the woman or her vehicle between Nov. 22 and Dec. 15. 

Diana Cojocari asked a distant relative to ""smuggle"" her and her daughter away from her husband, telling him she was in a ""bad relationship"" and wanted a divorce, according to a search warrant obtained by Law &amp; Crime. Phone records reviewed by police showed ""extensive communication"" between that relative and Madalina's mother on Dec. 2 of last year.

Meanwhile, that relative's phone records showed ""multiple calls to phone numbers belonging to unidentified targets involved in ongoing T3 drug/narcotic trafficking investigations,"" according to earlier reporting by WCNC. 

Madalina's mother and Palmiter argued on Nov. 23, according to Law &amp; Crime. The next morning, the man drove away to his family's house in Michigan. The girl's mother told police she noticed that her daughter was missing on Thanksgiving, which was Nov. 24, but did not contact her husband until Nov. 26.

North Carolina Police Accuse Parents Of Withholding Information About Missing 11-Year-Old Daughter
When police asked the mother why she didn't report the girl missing right away, she replied that she ""was worried it might start a 'conflict' between her and [Palmiter],"" according to court documents reviewed by the outlet.

Palmiter allegedly told police that he left on Nov. 23, but hadn't seen the girl for about a week before his trip. When he returned, he allegedly claimed that he'd asked Diana if she was hiding the girl, and she said no but asked if he was. He allegedly also said he wasn't.

In a December press release, Cornelieus Police Department Captain Jennifer Thompson characterized the vexing case as ‚Äúa serious case of a child whose parents clearly are not telling us everything they know.""


Mecklenburg County Commissioner Pat Cathom said she was glad police are ""working on [the case] constantly ... and don't consider it a cold case"" after Tuesday's event. 

‚ÄúI know everyone misses her ‚Äî her family and her friends at her school,‚Äù Cotham said. ‚ÄúSo, hopefully she‚Äôll be returned soon.‚Äù

Baucom said he was confident that the girl would ultimately be found.

"Ik rij zelf een stekkerloze Toyota Auris Hybrid uit 2013. ~15k aanschaf, tot nu (toegegeven: deels door chiptekorten etc) geen afschrijving na ~50kkm rijden. Ik verwacht dat mijn volgende auto een tweedehands EV wordt. 

Het verbruik waar je mee rekent klinkt erg optimistisch. Kijk eens op de [verbruiksmonitor van Autoweek](https://www.autoweek.nl/verbruiksmonitor/) naar verschillende modellen. Dan zul je zien dat 1:23 voor hybride eigenlijk niet realistisch is, en 1:18 voor veel benzineauto's ook niet. Tenzij je op snelwegen √©cht nooit harder dan 100 rijdt, √©n weinig binnen de bebouwde kom rijdt. Na 19:00 wel harder rijden op de snelweg? Kan je het vergeten.

Schakelen verleren zou ik me weinig zorgen om maken. Ik rij deze auto nu vijf jaar, maar schakelen gaat nog prima wanneer het bij uitzondering moet. Bijvoorbeeld toen ik laatst met de aanhanger naar de stort ging in een geleende diesel stationwagon, of toen ik een verhuisbus huurde. 

Onderhoudskosten verschillen erg. De ANWB heeft occassion-tests op de website staan, en verschillende sites geven betrouwbaarheidscijfers. Iets als een Audi A2 ziet er eerst leuk en schattig uit, totdat je motorkap open doet en ontdekt dat de monteur absoluut nergens bij kan. Dan loopt de beurt snel op. Toyota heeft bij de merkdealer vaste onderhoudspakketten waar al het kleinmateriaal, olie, etc al in zit. Vaste prijs, geen gezeik. Ik zit inclusief bijzonderheden zoals nieuwe banden op gemiddeld ‚Ç¨450/jaar aan onderhoud. Banden zijn voor deze auto relatief duur omdat ik een model met 17"" velgen heb (toeval, geen voorkeur). 

Als je echt gewoon van A naar B wil komen zou ik kijken naar iets als een tweedehands Toyota Yaris hybrid uit ~2013-2018. Bescheiden autotjes, betrouwbaar, en goedkoop in onderhoud, brandstof, en wegenbelasting.

Tot slot heeft de ANWB een [autokostencalculator](https://www.anwb.nl/auto/autokosten). Ik vind die wat pessimistisch, maar het geeft in elk geval een mooie checklist van welke kosten je mee kan nemen.",0.054498754,0.74327505,0.20222628

Anyway  here's some good education... Whatever the car manual recommends it's the minimal requirement for the car to be in warranty.... As mentioned, the car manufacturer does not care how long the car lasts after the warranty period.

That said don't believe in the BS about 10K mile oil changes... If you plan on keeping the car for a long time keep to at 5000 mile oil changes with full synthetic....

Where ever you change your oil they will use the cheapest full synthetic oil that they can get hold of... even the dealer...

Reason why you want to keep it at 5000 miles is so you don't wear out the piston rings so then the car starts burning oil and eventually killing your catalytic converter.

Note: I have a 2005 Toyota Scion tC with 171K miles and have been doing 5000 mile oil changes with mobil 1 and the car does not burn oil.

Here's a good video from The Car Care Nut on what happens to a cars engine at 10K mile changes.

[https://youtu.be/TJhFAwFv-O0](https://youtu.be/TJhFAwFv-O0)

This applies to all cars... not just Toyota... it's all marketing to increase  recommend oil changes to say their car needs less maintenance ... same thing with the CVT automatic transmission..... .. So such thing as lifetime fluid for the transmission.

IF you plan to not keep the car for long just follow what the manual says...

But if you plan to keep the car long... just keep track of the mileage and keep it at 5000 miles with full synthetic .... and monitor the oil levels ....",0.08771796,0.8209005,0.09138157

Most parents don't have 3 kids. For the outlier than is a 3 kid family, you hope they planned ahead. For the above average with 2 kids, literally any car is fine. For the below average with 1 kid

&gt; On top of that, as kids get older, they need more space.

Corolla that can fit 3 kid seats is the cheaper car. it's easily available on the 2nd hand market. It's a downgrade in price but an upgrade in suitability.

Power steering rack is leaking fluid, which seems to be a common problem and expensive to repair. About 450 for the rack from Toyota, plus labor. I haven't gotten it done, yet.

All of the lug nuts were blown out so bad the lug wrench wouldn't fit, so I replaced all of them and it was not cheap.  A 1/2 inch drive breaker bar with a size larger socket will do the trick if trying to save money.

The biggest performance gain will be more aggressive tires. Ensuring that it has adequate skid plates and recovery points front and rear would be good too.If you lift it and put significantly bigger tires on you will gain traction and clearance but be working the transmission harder.

I feel like these types of vehicles benefit from staying as light as possible. Even a traditional 4x4 will suffer a noticeable performance penalty from things like rooftop tents and winch bumpers. A lot of Jeeps and Toyotas I see driving around town are probably pushing up on their GVWR without any camping gear. So try to be intentional about adding weight.

You can get winch cradles that mount in a trailer hitch although they need a straight pull and are not a light unit. Another option I used for years and still carry sometimes is a come-along.

"This is probably irrelevant since it's not NA but here it goes.

The Yaris we get are made in France, albeit the Slovakian factory that makes the Aygo started Yaris production as well since demand for Aygo is crumbling and demand for Yaris is always strong.

The Yaris Cross should be made in the same French factory but so far all we got, every single one, were made in Japan. 

The Corolla hatchback is made in the UK, while the wagon and sedan are made in Turkey.

The C-HR is made in Turkey but it doesn't matter because with the Yaris Cross now available sales have completely stopped.

The RAV4 and the Prius are exclusively made in Japan. Note we don't even have a delivery date for the new Prius. 

Some HiLux are made in South Africa and some in Thailand: this is a demand situation since these things sell out as soon as there's a dealership allowance.

You get the idea.

Leaving the Aygo aside (very low build quality all around for almost Yaris money) only real difference I've found so far is vehicles made in Japan have better plastic moldings than the rest: it's rather common to replace a few moldings over the first 5 years on pretty much all vehicles not made in Japan bar the HiLux because they just break so easily. For the rest you could say they are all made in the same factory. 

The only real issue with the present RAV4 (and all Dynamic Force powertrains) is there's a very high chance the EGR cooler will corrode and start dumping coolant in the engine. Not the first time Toyota cheapened materials in an engine component and paid dearly for it. Toyota acknowledged the issue in February 2022 but is presently in denial phase.

"Out of your list, the best all rounders for both city and remote travel would be the Prado or Pajero in my opinion.  The decision would ultimately depend on how often you plan on doing remote travelling.  If you plan to do it a lot then I would pick the Prado.

The reason being:

- The Prado has a body on frame construction making it more insulated to vibration which will help a lot on the corrugated rural roads.  My Pajero shakes violently  even on dirt roads at times.

- Toyotas are more common in remote/rural areas meaning mechanics are more likely to have experience and spare parts when needed.  I‚Äôd say you‚Äôd have a much better chance for example getting a wheel off the shelf for the Prado in a country town than for the Pajero with its +46mm offset.

-  If you ever consider towing, the live rear axle of the Prado will give you more ball weight to play with, allow more even tyre wear and is less finicky to find springs that can handle loaded/unloaded weights.

"&gt;	How much of the 30k maintenance recommended by the dealership is even necessary? 

Almost none of it.

$110 is steep. You‚Äôre paying a hefty convenience premium to have them do it. I know not everyone has the tools or desire to do their own oil changes, but I‚Äôd reconsider using the dealership for this price. 

&gt;	Engine and cabin air filters (diy)110 

Ungodly expensive. You can get both at any auto parts store and change them both within 15 minutes. $50 max. 

&gt;	Brake flush 170 

Completely unnecessary at 30,000mi, especially for a vehicle that does so much of its braking with electric motors. This alone tells me that their services are just blindly ‚Äúrecommended‚Äù to every customer no matter the condition of their vehicle.

&gt;	Replace rear diff fluid 120 

Completely unnecessary. Toyota recommends changing the rear differential fluid **IF** you have been towing, and even then that‚Äôs only every 60,000mi. 

&gt;	Alignment (car drives fine) 180 

Alignments are only necessary if there‚Äôs evidence you‚Äôre out of alignment (uneven tire wear). Alignments are quick and easy money for dealerships.

"No. **HELL NO**

This is a car you buy when you're 30+ and ready for something fun that you can handle. You will *kill* yourself if you buy this as your first car. 

Your first vehicle should be a cheap front wheel drive POS that won't put you in financial ruin if you get into a minor accident. Something you can beat on and not worry about as you learn the ins and outs of how a car works. Like a 2000s/2010s Toyota Camry (or a Scion TC if you want something more flashy). But don't go too old because of safety concerns. In 10-15 years, once you're confident enough in your driving skill, then and *only* then should you consider upgrading to something with rear wheel drive and a little bit more horsepower. 

I'm 34 and I go easy on my 3.8 Genny because I respect the vehicle. Even at this age I'm not 100% confident in my ability to handle a 300+ horsepower engine with rear wheel drive. It is *way* too easy to crash this car, even as an experienced driver.

"Howdy friend, I‚Äôm only 19 but my mom buys cars often so I have a bit of advice. 1st, never buy a brand new car, ever. It looses value the moment it‚Äôs off the lot. Try and get something 4-5 years older as it is still new and has great features but has already gone through most of its depreciation. 

2nd, always buy from a private seller if you have a mechanic you trust. Private sellers allow you to negotiate greatly, allowing you to pay even less for the car. If you have a mechanic you trust ask the seller to allow you to take the car to them or to meet you there with the car to have your mechanic check everything out. Seller should be willing to pay for this, but if they aren‚Äôt you should pay it. You‚Äôd rather loose a few hundred max then loose thousands if the car has a problem. 

Furthermore, research which Camry hears were the best. Toyotas are typically reliable but every car has it‚Äôs good and bad years. Make sure you don‚Äôt get one from a bad year. 

That‚Äôs about it. I suggest using Facebook marketplace to look for private sellers or OfferUp/let go. Craigslist is also pretty solid so check there as well. 


You are doing very good compared to most of the population OP especially given the times we are living in. You (and I) have time on our side. Use it to your advantage and do the Roth IRA as soon as you comfortably can.

Also last tip, try to avoid car payments right now. Financing at 6%-7% will kill you.

For the few times I've charged:

* Toyota app reports 9.25 kWh vs 15.6 actual
* 8.1 kWh reported vs 15.8 actual
* 4.28 reported vs 8.36 actual

**So it's usually off by about 50%.** I can also confirm that the % charge reported by the app is garbage. In the 15.6 kWh example above, the app reported the charge as increasing from 33% to 100% and spent the last hour at 99% even though the wattage remained constant. The whole battery is 18.1 kWh so the reality was probably a linear charge from roughly 10% to 90% with some parasitic loss.

FWIW, the estimated time to complete charging has been very accurate. Within 10min every time, even during a full day charge. For reference, on a wall outlet, the car pulls a pretty constant 1360W for most of its charge time, dropping lower during the last 20-30min. The manual lists empty-to-full charge time is 12hr, but I have consistently gotten closer to 11:45 and the app estimates 11:50. It has been similarly accurate on partial charges, too.

I charge at night and can compare to the hourly power usage on my power bill so I know that the wattmeter is nearly correct (&lt;&lt;5% error).

It looks kinda factory, and you can close the cubby door and hide it.

In my minivan, I actually have one going to a jack I installed on the side of the A pillar, which can reach my phone mounted to the windshield. The other goes into the glovebox...

"Tough comparison only because the 3.5 V6 has been around for a long time. Any issues it might have had, they will be likely all ironed out. 2.5T in comparison is relatively new. Toyota rarely introduces a new engine and when they do, they'll use it for as long as possible and in every vehicle possible to maximize their return for how much it costs to develop it. Not to say Toyota is infallible and never had to issue a recall, but I would feel comfortable in saying that their newer engines are worth the risk.

Then there is the distinction between failure from poor design, poor quality control or poor maintenance and maintenance direction. The biggest issue with turbo engines/direct injection is that the maintenance and cost to repair in the event of failure are more expensive to repair, even if the engine isn't prone to failure. Because they are more complex with high precision parts that expensive to produce (ie Turbo and the injectors).

I would say go for the 3.5 V6 because it is tried and true, and been around long enough that part availability will be more economical. Ask on r/Cartalk",0.23538195,0.657098,0.10752

A Toyota among bicycle companies.

Almost all people.

Specialized's actual mission, of course, is to get people to exchange currency for bicycles, parts, apparel, and accessories.

The Verge has a [interesting article](https://www.theverge.com/23631257/specialized-globe-haul-st-specs-pics-design-ebike-interview) about the Haul, and Specialized's 3rd resurrection of the [Globe sub-brand.](https://www.instagram.com/globebikes/?hl=en) 

Specialized [initially launched Globe in 1994](https://roadbikeaction.com/the-phenomenon-of-the-specialized-globe/) as a way into the untapped urban/commuter market with a trendy, upscale, retro-cool line of bikes ""inspired by Vienna and San Francisco"".  But it never took off.

They [had another go in 2010](https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-relaunch-globe-urban-brand/), with another line ""aimed at discerning urban cyclists, based on mix of San Francisco and Dutch culture"" including a Haul model, ""In a style more reminiscent of the French builders in the 1940s and ‚Äô50, Specialized has designed a modular frame that includes a load-bearing rear rack. The 100-pound carrying capacity is impressive, and the upper rack has wings for attaching panniers, with hooks engineered into the forged dropouts to secure the load.""  But nobody bought them and Globe vanished once again, although the Roll model lives on as a main-branded comfort/transport bike.

So the trend seems to be that when Specialized wants to break their performance mold do something trendy to capture the urban/commuter market, they dust off Globe to do so.  [Like Scion (RIP).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_(automobile))  Maybe to reassure their existing customers.  Who knows.  In this case, ""resurrecting the Globe name for a new lineup of heavy-duty, moderately priced electric cargo bikes. For years, the Morgan Hill, California-based company has watched as e-bikes from a new crop of direct-to-consumer brands like Rad Power Bikes, Aventon, and Lectric were flooding the market and winning over consumers with their versatility, accessories, and affordable prices. And now, Specialized is wading into the fray. ""

I think they made a great entry, myself.  It's what you'd expect of a cargo ebike from the S badge; well designed and built, attractive, upscale.  They did a great job making it modular, and their huge rider database allowed them to make a frame that actually fits people from 5'4"" to 6'4"", so a family can share it.  

But their smartest move was the wheels, IMO.  They know how y'all love chubby little wheels, and 20"" does make sense for a cargo bike with a 410lb load cap.  But did they go with [fat tires (3.7""+)](https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/mountain-bike-tires.html) or [something in Plus?](https://www.bicyclebuys.com/cst-big-boat-tire-20x3.0%E2%80%99%E2%80%99-aramid-black/0621472?gclid=CjwKCAjwoIqhBhAGEiwArXT7K57cZkRHQxPLINOBvVugIL3io-8IB_rBGcJSJtiNoOqUXtfuK5pU7xoCA2UQAvD_BwE)  Nope.  20x3.5"".

The suspect eventually crashed his Toyota Corolla but managed to steal the CHP cruiser shortly after. The pursuit continued to the Lancaster area where the suspect jumped out of the car at a high rate of speed.

"A fuel cell is a non-reversible battery, though, meaning the only way to get the ""charge"" back is to fill it again with fuel; hence the name ""fuel cell"". Which makes them far less interesting than the kind of rechargeable battery you find in EVs. With an EV, for example, I can charge at home, and even use the extra energy from my solar panels to recharge it, whereas with an hydrogen car I would be restricted to only refueling it at refueling stations; for anyone with a garage, like me, being able to charge at home is a HUGE advantage already for EVs.

Incidentally, fuel cell cars still have a conventional EV battery in them, though a small one; in this aspect they are closer to hybrids than to EVs. Fuel cells not being reversible would make it impossible to have, for example, regenerative braking without adding a conventional battery ‚Äî and without regenerative braking the already poor efficiency of hydrogen cars would be brought even lower.

And the efficiency makes all the difference. At current efficiencies, the same amount of renewable energy would give 2x‚Äì4x times the mileage when used to recharge an EV than when used to generate hydrogen for use in hydrogen cars, meaning you can support 2x‚Äì4x more EVs than hydrogen cars with the same power generation infrastructure.

One side-effect of that increased efficiency is that the ""fuel"" cost per mile is much lower for EVs. Ask a Toyota Mirai owner and a Tesla owner how much it costs in hydrogen or electricity to drive a hundred miles and compare; the Mirai is much more expensive. And it will remain that way unless the efficiency gap is narrowed or eliminated, which would require the development of some way to generate liquid hydrogen at close to 100% efficiency, which doesn't seem to be physically possible at all. And this doesn't even take into account how residential power generation ‚Äî like, say, installing solar panels on your roof ‚Äî can further lower power costs for those that do engage in it, which gives a further cost advantage for EVs.

And no, pipelines don't have a lower cost. Quite the opposite, they cost far more to build than transmission lines, have higher maintenance costs, and to top it all hydrogen is a pain in the ass to work with, being far more prone to leaks than just about any other non-corrosive gas known to man (though at least it isn't toxic in the way natural gas is).

"Your example about using keywords is kinda useless for a brand like Ford, or Toyota, or VW. Those brands all rely on a specific syntax in their part numbering systems, that when used correctly, allow anyone to find any part within seconds. A skilled and experienced parts counterperson can look at a part number and instantly tell what model it's for and what kind of part it is. Memorize prefixes and sub-groups, and you can find anything, often with no diagram needed. That might not work for the DIY customer who would prefer a keyword search, but realistically, DIY customers are a small percentage of the parts business. 

Again, I hear where you're coming from. But if the general public had full access to our resources, it would be just an avalanche of wrong parts, customers blaming us for the wrong parts, and damaged returns. For us, making sure the customer gets the right part is a big source of pride. You may be one of the customers who gets it right when looking up your own parts, who knows?

"It's too late to do anything about it.. Yeah. 2013 and 2014 Subarus that had the FB engine series are known for oil consumption issues.  That's when about the time when Subaru switched over to the new FB/FA engine series..  So they have timing chain and not timing belt. Subaru did give an extended  warranty for oil consumption issues... that was for 8 years/100K miles whatever came first.  Also what's ridiculous is 2013-2014 Subarus had a 7500 mile recommended oil change interval and in 2015 Subaru of America dropped it to 6000 miles because of complaints of oil consumption issues  and never notified the owner of the car.

In order to qualify for the extended warranty had to burn more than a quart of oil every 1200.

Subaru‚Äôs statement that burning one quart of oil for every 1,000 to 1,200 miles is perfectly acceptable.

For those that qualified they would replace the short block of the engine.

I have a 2014 Outback and around 90K miles I got the low engine oil light... and that was changing at 7500 mile intervals... I did one more light on in another 7500 miles.. so at at point I researched it and got pissed at Subaru for not notifying me at least about the oil change interval and now dropped it down to 5000 miles and at the same time I learned more about cars and changed the PCV valve and hose.. so I'm not sure if the PCV valve helped but at 5000 miles I don't really notice burning more I might have some but not sure til I replace the valve cover gaskets and spark plug seals.  Note: I've been using Mobil 0w20 from the 2nd oil change... and now have 125K miles.. note  500 Miles ago I just switched to 5w30 mobil 1 high miles...

Also switched my dad's 2017 Forrester 5w30 too.. he is at 39K miles.. Will be doing his differential fluids soon and also his PCV valve. Also considering doing his CVT fluids too.  And also switched my dad's change interval to 5000 miles too.

As for you... I suggest you start using  Mobil1 or valvoline  full synthetic 5w30 and change out your PCV valve to see if that helps ...

[https://youtu.be/FZYnn\_49rOE](https://youtu.be/FZYnn_49rOE)

Also check for oil leaks in your engine bay and under your engine.

do a search for what others are doing ... I read some others are using 0w40 valvoline full synth .. but I would definitely change your PCV valve since there is no change interval... normally for cars in general it's recommend to get it changed every 30K-50K to avoid possible clogging or partial clog..

Yeah my 2005 Toyota Scion tC 2005 has 171K miles and doesn't burn at all or that I notice in 5000 mile mobil 1 5w30 oil changes.. So glad I just stuck to 5000 miles on that car since the Maintenance light, but that car was recommend 5000 miles  with conventional oil... now today Toyota recommends 10K miles.... but keep it at 5000 miles..

What I also found out that the engine in my scion also has oil consumption issues for Toyota.... so other Toyotas and scions had issues... if you do not change it regularly... and don't listen to the manufacture recommendations.

I also found out the oil change intervals and recommended services are really only the bare minimum to keep the car in manufacture  warranty....

Please watch this video from Car Car Nut....

https://youtu.be/TJhFAwFv-O0

So if you want to keep that car.. get the CVT fluid changed ASAP.. which Is not in any service schedule for Subaru of America... but there is a service schedule of 60K in  Subaru of Canada/Japan and the rest of the world.... the believe in the BS lifetime fluid.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know if you want to DIY you oil change and switch to a thicker oil at least... Note Subaru of Japan use to recommend 5w30 for their cars.. but recently changed it to 0w30.... So I don't like listening to Subaru of America advice.... keep your oil changes to 5000 miles... learn to inspect the engine grab a pair of wheel ramps for $55-$65 see if there's leaking of oil... change out the PCV valve it's worth doing that...",0.50358367,0.4760655,0.020350832

I highly doubt that'll happen anytime soon. If Google sees actual competition from Bing for AI search, they'll iterate on their own.

Apple has historically done very poorly with software adoption outside their hardware market. They'll likely see success with it on their devices, but I really don't see them touching the broader non-Apple market. They already kind of have a search engine with Siri, and I'm guessing they'll just be iterating on that by integration the same search backbone into their Mac ecosystem.

But Apple isn't going to be a serious competitor to Google in the search space outside their hardware products anytime.

Oh, I certainly expect companies to get on the ChatGPT bandwagon. Most sites already have a site wide search and bot chat, so this would largely combine those. And then a few years later they'll likely realize that there wasn't a big change in user engagement vs before they brought in ChatGPT.

Yeah, it's cool, but I don't really see a huge value proposition there. Are customers *really* going to buy Ford instead of Toyota because the search feature is better? Are they going to significantly reduce support costs because customers can find answers to their questions on the website? I think the improvements to the bottom line will be marginal at best.

My coworker played with Bing chat for a few days, and now uses Google again. Why? Because Google ""just works."" ChatGPT is fun, Google (and other search engines) are for work.

Most of that is old hat now. F1, iirc, now uses electric motors on the compressor side of the turbo to keep it spooled up and WRC, from what I read recently, have just banned air bypass systems instead they will iirc be enforcing direct injection and exhaust gas recirc valves for ALS.

"I am a lay person but went down a rabbit hole because I was looking into clean energy stocks at one point.  One rabbit hole lead me down hydrogen for vehicles.  

&amp;#x200B;

1.  We are already working on a cleaner power grid.  (Solar, wind, etc.)
2. You can feed this electricity into a very very dirty battery power system (Battery electric vehicles BEV's)  OR  Feed this electricity into making hydrogen gas from water, and then to a hydrogen powered fuel cell (FCEV).  Your corner gas station can become a hydrogen producing/filling station, it just needs water and electricity.  We already have the real estate (gas/petrol stations), we just need to convert some of those pumps into hydrogen pumps.  Toyota is betting that the energy dense hydrogen is a better solution than BEV.  Japan already has \~150 H2 stations.  The US has a few dozen, but only in CA.  
3. Hydrogen will also burn in an ICE engine, maybe Toyota wants to keep this alive since they're arguably the best at it?  Maybe Toyota knows it's lost the game when it comes to EV's so they're throwing a wrench into BEV's image?  Just to keep their stake alive in the auto world?  (my own personal conspiracy theory) 

Problems (of many others)

1.  98% of the H2 gas for vehicles comes from natural gas.... yep, a dirty fossil fuel is used to make a ""clean"" fuel.  We haven't quite figured out how to scale H2 production using water to be less costly that using natural gas/methane.  So when you see a bus that's powered by Hydrogen and its emissions are water, that H2 came from natural gas.
2. The hydrogen fuel cells on these cars are still super expensive.  Toyota reportedly loses $100K per Mirai it sells.  
3. Where the hell you gonna fill up your H2 car in the USA?

"We moved to a heavily wooded lot, 2 acres, honestly great. First few years, absolutely no issues. But across the street is a huge field being turned into an HOA subdivision ‚Äî part of how we got our place. So as the field is filled with houses, the wildlife there is being displaced day by day.

The mice struck in the early winter of 2021‚Äî my husband working from home full time &amp; me newly pregnant with #3, we were barely driving at all ‚Äî queue a cold snap that locks us down for a full week in February. It was all the mice needed to strike. They moved into every nook and cranny of my Toyota Sienna, and my husband didn‚Äôt believe me when I said something smelled off the next time we got in our car and ran the heat. ‚ÄúYour pregnancy nose is just super sensitive, nothing to be concerned about.‚Äù

I pestered and pleaded and finally got him to comb over the car. Mice nests in the engine, in the wheel wells, in the air box ‚Äî they had used our car as refuge, and they refused to give up. We did every trick in the book ‚Äî bleach, ozone machine, peppermint, car HVAC cleaning ‚Äúbombs,‚Äù mouse traps, poison traps, smell deterrents, a full detailing &amp; disinfecting, among many other things. But it was too late for the Sienna. Every time we thought they were gone, the AC would pump death through the car, or we‚Äôd find another nest. Worst was when our car died on the highway on the way to the airport for a family vacation ‚Äî come to find out upon arriving home they‚Äôd taken to chewing our wiring harness, costing us even more money to get the car running. I was in my 2nd trimester &amp; losing my mind, so I scoured the internet for help like I never had before.

Come to find out, rodent damage is covered by comprehensive car insurance, which my fantastically smart husband has had on all of our cars for as long as I can remember. So we file our claim, bring it to the dealer to assess the damage, and expect the trial is largely over once they complete the repairs &amp; have the car cleaned. 

The dealer sends us the pictures. The mice had been living in the walls and ceiling of our car. By the time they stopped calculating the repairs, it was over 15k of damage these nefarious rodents had caused. They probably had laughed at us for the months we‚Äôd spent pathetically failing to uproot them. Insurance gets the info from the dealer &amp; considers the car a total loss.

The one bright spot in all this was that the way our insurance calculated the car‚Äôs value, we were able to pay off our car‚Äôs loan as well as the remainder of what we had left on the second HVAC (about 6k). We scraped together enough to make a small downpayment on a replacement, and thankfully rates were low enough that we weren‚Äôt totally screwed by the market at the time. 

But man, never in a million years did I think this was a thing that happened to anyone, but we literally became ‚Äúdon‚Äôt affect the wildlife‚Äù people to ‚Äútime to commit mousey genocide‚Äù people.

"The gen 3 Prius can have oil burning issues, in theory, it‚Äôs one of the few flaws, so I stick to the 5k mileage oil change at this point. I was going 10k earlier in its life. Full synthetic is required.

And yes, repairs will come up - a replacement hybrid battery, installed at my home with lifetime warranty, is about $1800. A little less. But even 10 cents a mile at 150,000 miles gives me $15k to spend on repairs and still come out at under 30 cents a mile for expenses.

And to be clear - I don‚Äôt plan on or anticipate actually spending $10k in repairs.

"That's getting up there in the miles... 

The one thing I will say about these, as well as other similar vintage Toyotas, is that the u660 6 speed transmissions in these can get crappy when they age if they do not get regular fluid changes... Typically, problems will show up as clunky or slow shifts, delayed downshifts if you hit the gas, sometimes they will shudder and do all kinds of weird things. They also have issues with the transmission valve bodies and solenoids when they get up in the miles. Most of these things will be evident in a thorough test drive, so just check it over thoroughly. 

These transmissions really do need fluid changes every 50k or so if you want them to last, although the factory manual implies that the fluid is good for the life of the transmission under certain circumstances, which really doesn't help.

I can't recall if this model year still has hydraulic power steering or not, if it has hydraulic power steering, check the inner tie rod end boots for evidence of a leaking power steering rack... The Toyota racks very often will be leaking by this mileage and will require a steering rack replacement to fix this.

"&gt; having a model run of an engine with a fault that can be retrofitted

Unbelievable, and you obviously know exactly what you're doing here with the phrase ""can be retrofitted"".  Yes, it can be retrofitted because LN Engineering, a third party manufacturer, designed the tools to do it at a time when Porsche wouldn't even acknowledge the problem, and it was still a $3000 fix.  Porsche didn't come up with its own replacement until 2017, literally 20 years after they sold the first cars that were affected by the issue.

&gt; Every car company has had recalls. Even Mazda. Even fucking Toyota had issues in the last decade.

Except they didn't recall the car, did they?  They continued to sell it and deny there was a problem until their own customers finally sued them for damages.  And even then, the settlement only covered certain models and model years and had recovery limits.  You haven't even tried to defend Porsche's conduct because you know it is completely indefensible, especially for a brand that promotes itself on quality, and any honest discussion about what happened with IMS would make it obvious that they should be ranked dead last on both build quality and customer service.  You can't argue quality when 10% of Porsche engines fail because the company didn't use the right part.

&gt; If I wanted a totally reliable utility to live forever, I‚Äôd buy a Toyota 4Runner.

The Delica is a pregnant Pajero. Same chassis, same eninge options, just a different body. Think of it as the Mitsubishi Troop Carrier. Aftermarket support is harder to come by as the different body means Pajero bars won't fit.

I've owned several Toyota trucks. They are mostly good trucks, but the frames on all of them are absolutely rust prone, with the older ones like this being the worst for rust. They can be ok if they are meticulously cared for though. It would be very difficult to find a non rusty frame on one of these in the north east. The bodies, unlike the frames, usually do not rust very much at all with the exception of the rear hatch and bumpers.

What I would recommend is that you get that thing up on a lift, and check the entire frame front to back with something like a screwdriver or ice pick... You want to poke at the frame everywhere and look for soft spots. Typically, these frames will rust out the bottom of the main frame rails front to rear, with the worst spots being in front of the rear wheels where the suspension trailing arms mount, and also the area immediately behind the front wheels. They also will typically rust really bad along all of the welds on the frame.

"\- I understand there may be some suspicion surrounding Vinfast, but this new car brand from Vietnam deserves a fair chance to prove itself. While it's true that Vinfast has paid influencers and journalists, this is not uncommon in the automotive industry. Many car companies do this to generate buzz and reach a wider audience. And not only car manufacturers, but all big products also pay for KOLs and media to cover the news, it's a common practice for any established company.

\- I don't know which posts/comments got deleted, because if you deleted them on Reddit, even by moderators, there will be a system message indicating that it was deleted by mods or users themselves. But I haven't seen a system message like that in this subreddit. All I see are negative comments, most are from you (?). I can say that the overall tone of this subreddit is negative.

\- As for the lack of comparison tests by established American outlets, it's important to remember that Vinfast is still a new player in the market. It takes time to establish relationships with media outlets and provide vehicles for long-term testing. They just started delivering a few weeks ago officially. As I stated before, all media outlets can go to Vinfast stores in California and make a test drive right now, but I guess they don't want to do a review for a new car brand, and it's understandable.

\- This car company obviously is not a scam but an effort of thousands of Vietnamese workers, just like Toyota and Hyundai started in the US decades ago. This will take them at least 10 years to prove their performance and gain the trust of customers.

\- Vinfast has shipped 999 cars to the USA, which is a good start and shows their commitment to the US market. It's important to give new brands a fair chance to prove themselves and not jump to conclusions based on speculation and rumors. More EV competitors are always good for a big market such as the U.S., the benefit will be the customers.",0.14894,0.7696345,0.08142554

Looked at purchasing a 2015 Toyota Avalon Hybrid Limited today from a private seller. I brought a mechanic along for a PPI.

Everything checked out with the mechanic &amp; I was told the internals of the vehicle are in excellent condition. 

The only concern they brought up is the age of the hybrid battery &amp; the cost of replacing it in the near future. I don‚Äôt mind replacing the battery when it gets to that point. 

The seller is asking for $12,000. He seems inflexible on the price. Is this a good buy or should I keep looking?

"Gas price for 100 miles is under $8, call it $8. Tires are $500 every 80k miles, so a bit over half a cent per mile - 62 cents for 100 miles. Call it one dollar. Oil change is $92 every 5000 miles - $2 per 100 miles. Brakes‚Ä¶ the hybrid uses regenerative braking so my vehicle still has factory brake pads (at over 120k miles) and they still have half their life left. I‚Äôll call it $1 per 100 miles just for fun even though it has to be immensely less than that.

Depreciation is irrelevant as the car is older and I have no plans to sell it until it is effectively worthless, much like my last Toyota that I got rid of for $400. But let‚Äôs say I take the value of my car from $5000 now and drive it till it‚Äôs zero, which would be about 150k more miles. That puts it at a loss of about 3.3 cents per mile to depreciation. Call it 5 cents, or $5 per 100 miles.

I‚Äôm at $8 gas, $1 tires, $2 oil, $5 depreciation, $1 brakes. $17 per 100 miles. I was estimating these values deliberately higher than normal even, but I‚Äôm still WAY off from $65 per 100 miles. I genuinely don‚Äôt know how I could get even close. Best I can imagine in a worst case scenario is $25ish per 100 miles, so $25 out of my $150 income is costs to drive, aka about 17%. I have a feeling I‚Äôm really more like 12-15% though - and then of course the tax savings helps recoup a lot of that, but let‚Äôs say I get no savings.

&amp;#x200B;

"Yes, you can certainly still get slip with a 242. It's far from perfect and there are better center differential / AWD systems out there. There's better ways to have a center diff that can limit slip, such as a Torsen, a viscous coupling, or computer controlled, but none that are better that bolt right into an XJ. The 249 with a viscous coupling is generally considered junk, but the AWD mode is theoretically much more capable.

Apparently the Toyota Sequoia has my perfect transfer case - it has all the modes of a 242, but the center diff is a torsen.

Everyone mentions that it's an open diff and yeah, that means you can still get tire slip if you really goose it. But when you do have traction, you're still sending basically half the torque you would in 2WD to the rear axle, so you're less likely to spin in the first place.

Anyway, a 242 works for me. I have a 242HD on the shelf that is rated to a higher capacity than the beefiest 231 out there. I plan to install it when I do a manual swap. I'll probably add a torsen/truetrac front diff at some point, making the open center diff even less of an issue.",0.2650361,0.59998167,0.13498226
"This [data from RepairPal](https://repairpal.com/reliability/audi/a4) indicates that the Audi A4 has above average reliability for luxury sedans. It seems only slightly less reliable than the Q50 based on [this data](https://repairpal.com/reliability/infiniti/q50).

Doing my own calculations from the data, it looks like the Audi A4 has a 4.81% chance on any given year of needing a major/severe repair, whereas the Q50 is only slightly better, with a 4.64% chance of a major repair.

Also want to note that *reputation* for reliability commands a significant premium on the used market. I never recommend for anyone to get a used Toyota or Lexus because you‚Äôll pay much more for an equivalent car vs. another brand due to their reputation.

For example, for $18k the listings for an IS350 are all like 2009 models with 100k+ miles. Whereas with the Audi A4 (a direct competitor to the IS), that same $18k gets you a 2017 model with 60-70k miles.",0.565881,0.40548113,0.028637812

My Prius is at 81k miles, so i will check it out in the future. 

Also another reason i bought Prius is the ""stereotypes"" around here it is usually a second car or a wives car. Which in general means that people dont trash them and use them mostly in town and not on the drag strip. 

Buying a Mercedes or BMW has to be single owner of the most boring 50 year+ man/woman you can find or else it is only problems. 

I have owned my Prius for 2 years and had no problems execpt warranty job on my brakes since the Toyota dealership gave it to me with worn out brakes both front and back (steel on steel) but that got fixed, so I do not consider it a ""problem"" more inconvenience.

What I have done is:

Air filter / Cabin filter

Oil / oil filter + mos2 addetive Liqui Moly Ceratec

Engine and ECVT coolant 

ECVT oil

Spark Plugs

Liqui Moly Fuel System Cleaner in tank (I pretend this is the Fuel filter replacement)

Tire change winter/summer with brake service, see if pistons move, pads move and guide pins move. Lube up if needed. 

So this years service will probably just be an oil change.

Image Recognition was considered to be a purely human skill. Then one day it wasn‚Äôt everyone lost their shit and said all driving jobs were doomed. Did this happen? NO, it slightly improved traffic safety 5 years later when a serious org(toyota in this case) when it was integrated into emergency safety systems.

AI improves in fits and starts. The LSTM that is the great grand daddy of all these text models was invented in 1995.  It took the invention and scaling of an entire hardware industry to make it useful (the gpu). It took millions of people tens of thousands of hours researching to make the breakthrough that is GPT. The following models gpt3, gpt3.5, and gpt4 are incrementally better than their predecessors. 

A boom time for tech is coming while we figure out what it is profitable to use it for just like image recognition. Then silence for another 10 years as we wait for researchers to make another breakthrough. 

Also folks learn some stats before you make a vibes based assessment. No paper has been published that says we have defeated the vanishing gradient problem. The simplest way to see that it is still their is when the response becomes repetitive that means that the gradient descent has found a local minima to complex to escape. These tools as human as they seem are statistical models of what we would say.

"So I went back to enterprise and handed in the 330 because I need to move some boxes. They gave me a toyota CHR. 

I'm truly impressed'nt that the CHR is, IMO, a better driver's car than the BMW. Yes, it has worse acceleration, much worse so. and a CVT. But the steering and handling feels so much better in the FWD CHR. The steering wheel has a weight and heft to it that's communicative and intuitive. It's direct, it doesn't feel rubbery or vague. It inspires confidence. Also, it has a center console shifter, which is nice because the CVT will pretend to be a 7sp and you can just do the clicky thing. I DESPISE wheel mounted paddles (because you never know where they are in turns), so having a physical shifter is huge. Especially since BMW's shifter still takes up center console space, it just is dumb and gimmicky. 

I genuinely don't know how BMW screwed the pooch this much. The only logical explanation I can think of is that the 330 was purposefully made bad to differentiate it from the M340, because I cannot fathom this steering being put in the 340.

"One Suspect Caught, Four On The Run In Thefts At Lowe‚Äôs

PORTLAND, Maine ‚Äì On Tuesday, March 28th, 2023, Portland Police were on the lookout for a White Toyota 4Runner with Pennsylvania plates that had reportedly been used in a theft of over $10,000 worth of merchandise at Lowe‚Äôs in Brunswick earlier in the day. At 10:32 a.m., the vehicle was spotted at Lowe‚Äôs on Brighton Avenue in Portland and minutes later, five suspects emerged with stolen goods and returned to their vehicle. 

Police attempted to stop the vehicle before it fled at a high rate of speed. Less than a minute later, the 4Runner crashed into two different vehicles near the intersection of Brighton Ave. and Machigonne St., where it became disabled. The five suspects fled on foot, before one of them was apprehended. A Police K9 unit from Scarborough was called in to assist with tracking.

Police are still looking for the other four occupants of the vehicle. The only description we have at this time is that they are black males. Investigators are urging anyone who has any information that might assist in this or any other case to call them at (207) 874-8575.

These two videos are the ones I've watched and it seems easy enough.  I'm a tinkerer at heart - from computers to cars to guitars, I enjoy rebuilding things.

As far as it goes, when I watch these two videos and multiple other videos, all I think is how much more difficult changing the spark plugs on my 2011 Toyota Prius looked and was, and how easy this is in comparison.  I'm like, nervous, because it is my brakes, but at the same time I'm like there's no way it's *that* difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

The other hard part is I don't know how long the piston and seal boot has been messed up.  I bought the car at about 48k miles, it now has 65k, and the rear brakes were worn down to metal.  I really have no idea how long the piston boot has been torn like that, so it could have been the entire life span, it could have been recently.  It's such an unknown factor, that's why I'm like, okay I'll just rebuild it.

Honestly, if it was easily accessible, I'd 100% just buy the caliper.  But the only part I can find that has the electronic parking brake caliper is from the mitsubishi dealership, which costs $850 per caliper.  I mean, if it was like $50-$100 I'd just buy them but I'm not about to drop close to $2k when the caliper kit is like $8 and the process seems easy enough.

I appreciate your input!  I want to be preventative with my brakes, not reactive.  Especially since they are my brakes.

On top of the caliper dust boot being torn, i found out the caliper pins were really hard to move.  I saw a video of someone showing what a fresh caliper pin / boot cover should move, and it was so easy.  I had to use some force to get it to compress and that's another thing I'm replacing.  I'm just like jesus this caliper went through the ringer.",0.13135594,0.60015094,0.26849315

Alternatively, start checking all the larger Toyota dealerships somewhat in your area and check their website to see which are selling at MSRP.

Every mfr has a lunkey here and there, even Toyota and Honda.. Ford just seems to have had a lot of them.

I don't get the carrying on about GMs DOD, as they had a small percentage of them in the first few years that had some issues &amp; occasionally have some still that have issues, but there hasn't been near as many overall; not near as many, as the internet 'experts' and haters keep claiming.  

Of the ones that did happen, most of those were maintenance related(lack of oil changes) and the fix is still relatively easy and cheap - if they catch it in time and don't keep driving for another 1000miles + after it starts missing........ Also, IF a person wanted to just have a conventional valvetrain, the fix is still fairly easy and cheap. None of Ford's fixes can make that claim &amp; many simply can't be fixed.... 

You still can't get around the overall LS platform which is arguably the greatest engine architecture and platform ever produced. Period. GM has had some real wins with the various SBC, BBC and several 4cyl &amp; 6cyl  platforms since the mid 50's and few Auto manufacturers have come anywhere close to that, overall.

 I give Ford credit for trying new things, but IMO, they need a better design protocols &amp; a better development and production approval process.....

"If you're trying to make a point about Honda's automotive earnings, you might not want to be using a source that includes the motorcycle earnings. $7-8B is with automobiles, motorcycles, boats, planes, lawnmowers, banking, insurance, and all the other side businesses that roll up into $HMC. 

[Here's the relevant slide from their investors report about how that $8b is typically broken out by business unit.](https://imgur.com/572LAOK). 

There's a good argument for how a good chunk of Honda Financial Services can be attributed to the automotive division, since you can't sell car loans, insurance, maintenance plans, or extended warranties for cars without actually selling the car; just about everything sold to you by the finance person gets attributed to the financial services division. But Honda is really vague on how they make money through financial services and they hint that their car loans actually lose money; so a lot of that earnings might be from plain-ol-investing since they do have $90B in financial assets.

Also careful with the comparison between automakers in your source; while most automakers have a finance division, not all of them have other financial services (notably insurance and classic banking), and some of them spin out their finance division as a separate company from their automotive group (like Toyota, whose earnings on there include their textile business but not their banking business).",0.1870951,0.7570558,0.05584906

"&gt;  And when that was introduced they didn't have a great way to measure EV road usage

I think THIS is what needs modification.  The roads are a common good, and I benefit from the roads existing whether I drive on them or not.  

I agree that heavier vehicles cause more wear and tear, but I challenge you to put a dollar value on that.  Odds on, that pickup truck next to me on the road works out to 2-3 cents difference (not total, but difference) from my lighter car per year in road maintenance, whereas I imagine it is doing several dollars more damage per year to public health via the pollution - perhaps we should charge higher health insurance premiums for pickup drivers?  (Commercial trucks are another matter, and can be regulated separately.) 

And if you were worried about weight you'd want hybrids regulated differently.  They weigh more than their gas counterparts but get double the mileage, at least the Toyota models do, and are not subject to any special fees.

&gt;The new tax still doesn't address people who charge at home and circumvent the tax entirely.

"Yes i agree. I forgot to add before that i made all unlocks open from the start and balanced it by starting with no money. Having UOD I but struggling for money at the beginning changes the game completely and I'm enjoying it a lot more.

I haven't finished towing home the p16 or the other one in island lake yet, so right now my fleet is basically like

CK1500 and TrailCruiser Ute (Toyota) - Scouts

Unimog - Small cargo recovery, swamp rescue (Fitted with 1-slot sideboard and crane, or service tent) (Planning to buy a 2nd one so i dont have to keep swapping frame attachments)

Fleetstar - straight-truck and small trailer hauling (Basically any loose cargo up to 4 slots)

WWS - Semitrailer towing and heavy swamp rescue

I wish Unimog mod was a vanilla game feature, it's small but fun and not overpowered! I feel like I spend about half the game driving the unimog. To be clear this is the U4023 which has 8 normal gears, 3 low range gears, and 1 high range, permanent AWD and toggleable difflock in low range.

I was starting to use the unimog for scouting even though it's pretty slow, but it has low fuel consumption and can fit in tight trails because it's so small. But the Toyota has permanent difflock with toggleable 4WD (I assume that means it has a solid rear axle?), which is tons more convenient IMO. From what I've read about unimogs that is a common configuration for them, they have 2wd mode for the road and engaging 4wd automatically engages difflock.

"Whatever you do, you should not have a setup where the battery is in any way disconnected from the car's electrical system or the alternator, this will cause the voltage to be unstable and may damage electronics in the car.

If it were me, I would install the battery first and then see if this is really an issue. if it is, I would determine where the voltage regulator is, find the feedback circuit (for example, it is labeled ALT-S on Toyota 4Runners) and design a circuit to alter the feedback voltage according to the charging current.

as a related example, my brother has an AGM battery in his 4runner. AGM batteries require slightly higher float voltages than flooded batteries, so adding a doide or two to the ALT-S fuse can reduce the voltage seen by the voltage regulator, so that the alternator outputs slightly more voltage to compensate, raising the charging voltage.

In your case, you would instead need to make the voltage appear slightly higher to the regulator whenever you want to reduce the charging current. This would require sensing the output current of the alternator and generating a voltage higher than the battery voltage by a bit, but I wouldn't do any of this without verifying that you actually have a problem that needs fixing.",0.45408607,0.5230223,0.022891587

"I earn about $150-$175 average per 100 miles driven (door to door total mileage driven). Call it $150 to be easy.

Gas price for 100 miles is under $8, call it $8. Tires are $500 every 80k miles, so a bit over half a cent per mile - 62 cents for 100 miles. Call it one dollar. Oil change is $92 every 5000 miles - $2 per 100 miles. Brakes‚Ä¶ the hybrid uses regenerative braking so my vehicle still has factory brake pads (at over 120k miles) and they still have half their life left. I‚Äôll call it $1 per 100 miles just for fun even though it has to be immensely less than that. 

Depreciation is irrelevant as the car is older and I have no plans to sell it until it is effectively worthless, much like my last Toyota that I got rid of for $400. But let‚Äôs say I take the value of my car from $5000 now and drive it till it‚Äôs zero, which would be about 150k more miles. That puts it at a loss of about 3.3 cents per mile to depreciation. Call it 5 cents, or $5 per 100 miles. 

I‚Äôm at $8 gas, $1 tires, $2 oil, $5 depreciation, $1 brakes. $17 per 100 miles. I was estimating these values deliberately higher than normal even, but I‚Äôm still WAY off from $65 per 100 miles. I genuinely don‚Äôt know how I could get even close. Best I can imagine in a worst case scenario is $25ish per 100 miles, so $25 out of my $150 income is costs to drive, aka about 17%. I have a feeling I‚Äôm really more like 12-15% though - and then of course the tax savings helps recoup a lot of that, but let‚Äôs say I get no savings.

Worst case I earn $125 after expenses per 100 miles driven. Earning $150 takes me on average 5 to 6 hours - so worst case I‚Äôm still in the $20/hr range, after expenses. But again - tax savings boost that back up more.

"I got my 450h+ the end of Jan 2023. 100% of my everyday driving is within the 37 EV miles that Lexus claims. After driving it for about 1200 miles for two months, I put in gas for the FIRST time and it was 11.2 gallons and about $60. The gas that I did use was from a few long trips that are done infrequently. My 450h+ never calculated the advertised 37 EV miles, it started at 39 EV miles. Now, the more I drive my car, the more EV miles it calculates for me. It now says I will get 43 EV miles on a full charge and I find it's true. It keeps getting better and better. I do drive the speed limit and don't do a lot of herky-jerky driving.

It is a pain to charge at home with 120v so we will be getting a home charger. I had originally thought of getting a totally electric car, but knowing myself I didn't want to have range anxiety always wondering where I could charge up, especially when going on a trip. The 450h+ is perfect for me. Electric when I need it, which is most of the time, and gas when I need it, which is only once or twice a month.

For this perfect option, it does come with a price. You pay A LOT more for a car that allows you to buy less gas. You can argue you can buy a lot of gas with the thousands of dollars extra we paid for this car. We paid a lot for solar panels in order to have ""free"" electric to charge that car,  (that wasn't the main reason but it influenced how many panels we would purchase).But I really like the idea of sticking it to the fossil fuel companies and having a car that is safe, enjoyable to drive and is very stingy on gas.  You can't really go wrong with Toyota, Honda, or Lexus. I have been driving those brands exclusively for many years and have been thrilled with them. Very reliable cars.

Additional info: Well after posting the above I decided to get the manual out. When I filled the 450h I put in 11.1 gallons and never saw the refuel light on, (I had not read the manual).

I need a new car and I don't really have an option to wait for the market to change. I would really prefer to buy new for peace of mind. I was looking primarily at the toyota rav4 and camry as well as some mazda SUVs. Other cars I am considering would be honda civics/accords and Hyundai.

After engine gets rebuilt make sure you go through the break in period... and keep up with your oil changes with full synthetic oil every 5000 miles.. and do a PCV valve change every 30K-50K miles.

"I have worked in manufacturing my whole career, and currently run a manufacturing business.  

For at least 30 years manufacturing has had the ability to eliminate most manual jobs through automation.  This hasn't happened though.  

I imagine AI will follow a very similar path that automation has in manufacturing just being applied to white collar jobs instead of blue collar ones.  There will be some immediate unease with it, then a period where it is quite helpful to the workers, followed by some anger and resentment when whole positions are eliminated.  And at the end there will be a equilibrium that is reached, where workers and robots/AI work in conjunction with each other to meet goals.

In the 90's robotics was all the craze in manufacturing, which drove demand through the roof.  That resulted in it being unaffordable for many applications.  So automation expansion slowed greatly.  Companies like Toyota came up with other ways to increase productivity without the huge investment (simple machines that use things like gravity to do operations automatically).

Since tesla has to focus on quality on their products more as they are a young auto maker. But they have a high rate of fixing quality issues. I'll give them that. 

Other automakers does just exactly the same with their own core products, meaning parts they make them self. Mostly engine and body. Alot of other parts come from third party oem manufacturer. Like suspension, brakes, transmission, wheels etc.

Of course they have close partnership with these oem makers but they pack the same products in many cars.
Take the blower motor and fan for instance. It is probably the same in several models and years in the lineup. Across several brands as they build on a common platform. 

VW, seat, skoda, Audi, Lamborghini, Porsche and Bugatti share ALOT of parts for instance. 

Same with Volvo and renault. 
Fiat, Ferrari and Dodge. 
Hyundai and Kia. 
Toyota and Lexus 

The list goes on. 
A company that is world leader in continues improvements is Toyota. It is widely known.

"My thoughts exactly. Why do people keep buying this crap? Then I found out about their extended warranties. Kia knows these vehicles are designed to fail. They just warranty them and by the time you hit 100k miles it should be paid off to resell to a private party so some bozo with no credit can buy a vehicle made of glass for cash money not knowing what they just signed up for. Meanwhile the original owner is off to the lot to buy another over priced hunk of cheap parts to get rid of after 100k miles. 

Giving long time warranties to cheaply made products does not make your company good for business. Making a quality product should be number 1 priority but unfortunately the consumer's don't care about quality and practicality, they care about price. As long as they have the lowest prices and best deals on the lot, Hyundai and Kia will sell vehicles, regardless how poorly built and designed they are.

"Assuming you turn your nose up to minivans, like the awd Toyota Sienna then yes it would have to be a large SUV. 


In the super size category your options would be the Sequoia, Armada, Land Cruiser/LX, Ford Expedition, Suburban/Yukon XL, Escalade, Wagoneer/Grand Wagoneer, and Navigator. 
Of those I‚Äôd pick the Sequoia. Second choice would be the Armada. 
I had a Nissan Titan (all same under pinnings as the Armada) and generally I‚Äôd say it was reliable. The first gen had a bad design header which would crack between 60k and 150k miles, requiring replacement which also included primary cats. Aftermarket had solutions there that were stronger. Mine were going at 115k miles. Other than that the V8 and transmission were fantastic. 
Land Cruiser / Lexus LX is wonderful but soo expensive. 
The Suburban / Yukon XL owners I know find them to be decently reliable for major items. We have a family friend that only buys surburbans and drives across the country often. She typically will have one engine replaced under warranty between 100k and 200k miles. Most other people I know don‚Äôt have the same issues so I‚Äôm not sure what her deal it.

"&gt; As for EVS causing more damage. I‚Äôd be curious to know the cost incurred by vehicle type vs paid.

Cost is going to be dependent on miles driven.  The curb weight of a Tesla Model 3 is about 300lbs heavier than a Toyota Camry, that includes fuel so a Camry will gradually lose about 100lbs of weight as the tank empties.  So it's probably only a rounding errors difference.  But when you look at larger EVs like the Model Y, the weight is closer to 1000lbs difference.

All vehicles cause road damage, the road surface is a consumable wear item like a tire or a pencil.  The damage a vehicle does to the road is proportional to the weight and miles driven.  Heavier vehicles cause more damage, vehicles that drive more cause more damage.

Next Suzuki has announced their investment in a new battery manufacturing facility in India. This one is being built for pure EVs. Here local manufacturing and component sourcing will help reduce costs on the battery since the car part is already cheap for Suzuki in India.

"Thanks!

I did find that the Toyota Pickup booster will bolt right up, and will even accept the MR2 MC, but it will only work for auto AW11s, because the diameter of the booster is 9.5"" vs 8.2"" for the stock AW11 booster, and it won't clear the clutch MC. I looked at the others, but the bolt patterns were different. Didn't think about cross-referencing just the internal parts for the purpose of rebuilding. Good thinking!

I did find a place out in California who I called yesterday, and he said that he could get all the rebuild parts needed without any problem, and he had a turnaround of 2 business days from the time he receives it.

So I just ordered a booster from a SC 88 that I found from a salvage yard in FL. If that one is good when it gets here, I can use it, and if not, then I will send that one off to be rebuilt. Only cost me $100 including shipping, so add on the $200 or so for the rebuild, and I'm not much worse off than if I had been able to find a brand new NA one.

We'll see how the dust settles. Thanks again!",0.021069381,0.42829117,0.55063945

WA is the lucky state. In most Northern states electricity is expensive. I Massachusetts for example someone just posted $0.42 per KWh. 

And Norway is not a good indicator because they are crazy over there. Google how much coal, oil and gas they export.  And it is a dinky country. 

Gas cars sales maybe banned in some states like California but other neighboring states will still have gas car sales. Nevada is not a ZEV state. Neither is Arizona. So there will be plenty of ICE cars to buy.

And another thing. Few yours before 2035 there will be a huge rush to buy ICE cars and hardly any EVs will be sold. Also, if our next Government will be Republican this whole thing could be reversed. 

And you are wrong about gas prices too. There is a rule of supply and demand. If demand will be lower on gas prices will go down. If demand on electricity is going to be high prices will go up. It is happening right now actually. Many here on Reddit reported electricity prices going up and up. It will get worst for electric car users. Prices on public chargers are also going up. Tesla is up to $0.65 per KW. That is like paying $8 per Gallon of gas or more compared to the hybrid car. 

And you are wrong about renewable energy. 79% comes from fossil fuels. 12.5% from solar and wind and 8.5% is from nuclear. 

Oil will eventually be used up in like 50 years or so but Oil companies are not stupid. They would want to sell every drop of it. In order to do so they would have reduce prices, not increase prices. They are not just going to stop cold.

Apply a very liberal coat of the chosen product on everything - frame, control arms, axles, brakes, brake lines, drive shafts, bumper, receiver, spare tire rim &amp; area (**everything**) - under the truck.

My 2021 Tacoma was coated with WW two days after I bought it (July 2021). It now has 2 Chicagoland winters and 15k miles behind it, and there are no signs of undercarriage corrosion anywhere.

"IndyCar is closer to bringing back Toyota as a manufacturer than Porsche entertaining the thought of returning to a series that didn't want them to participate in the first place.

If they're no longer pursuing F1, they have no reason to enter IndyCar, because the intent behind the F1 entry was as either a stakeholder in an existing team operating under the current Concorde Agreement, or as an engine partner to an existing team that had F1 infrastructure already in place to take advantage of the increased visibility F1 has and the increased revenue that comes from participation as a stakeholder

"Problem with chassis/engines is the same as it was 15 years ago. There's not enough money to sustain this car count if they all gotta buy new chassis. Throw back to 2011 when we had 25 cars that ran the majority of the season, and I think now we're in a similar situation. There's so many chassis out there it's gotten more affordable for the little guy to run some races.
     I don't understand the engine manufacturers not buying in though. Hear me out, I know the financials are way different, but Toyota has the dominant midget engine. Toyota also banged out a new 410 ci 900+ hp Sprint car engine last year. I don't understand why Toyota would decide that dirt short track racing is their ""target audience"". They have their hand in nearly every form of racing in the US except IndyCar. And that's a puzzle to me. 
 All that aside, In spite of popular opinion, I don't think a new car/engine will move the needle a bit as far as gaining new fans. It hasn't worked in F1, as far as a new set of regs anyway, or Nascar, or anywhere but IMSA. What has worked is marketing, and engagement. I remember before the Richmond race in 2005 DC101 radio had Helio ""racing"" around the beltway live on air. It was fun. People showed up to the race because it was marketed. That's what we need. They need a show on Hulu, or Netflix. Somewhere that gen Z watches TV. They don't really watch traditional TV, Cable subs are at all time lows.

So i started looking at the crosstrek

Then I saw his videos on SUVs and I decided that I probably didn't need it and went back to looking at the impreza

But I want my vehicle to be electric awd, then I was looking at the solterra

But at the size of the solterra I can also just look at other companies for awd like the Toyota rav 4 prime

But I don't need an suv

Divorce favors women if kids are involved, no matter who has the better lawyers, and women have access to better divorce attorneys because precedents have been set.

Men tend to go bankrupt after divorces, losing their homes to their ex wives along with support and alimony, lose custody or have to fight tooth and nail for every second of custody or visitation, commit credit and custody-related suicide at a much higher rate, have a harder time finding a partner who can provide a second household income to rebuild, and end up houseless on the streets at a far greater rate BECAUSE the laws favor women so much in divorces.

"Ope, Another Minnesotan checking in(st Paul).  I'm a total gear head, so it's a special kind of torment to have one of the worst parts of each day be my highway commute into the east metro, aka 3M cancerland.  I totally agree that COVID and all of its ripples have made drivers much more brazen, but there's been a cruelty building up below the surface long before the pandemic, and it is very much tied to rising traffic deaths and our social collapse.  Look how much more sinister autos have gotten over the last decade, most new vehicles look like a PCP Micheal Bay Transformers fever dream.  Look at the new Toyota 4runner and tell me you don't see hate.  Now consider that there is a huge demand driving these aesthetics, and that it comes tandem with the demand for more acceleration, ride height and greater curb weight.  See the pattern?  Many of us, but especially the soulless suburban white people(Nazis even if they haven't accepted it yet), have a default adversarial nature towards everyone else around, and if they happen to single you out, you become their hate receptacle that they channel all of their thoughtless consumer life onto.  That may sound crazy and conspiratorial, but when you get your ass ridden, in the right lane, going 5 over by Uber Karen in her skull faced Cherokee, or the hideous bulldog maw of a blacked out ram truck with Komander Ken behind the wheel, every day, for years, you notice the pattern.  In my opinion, riding someone's bumper within inches is not too far from holding a knife to someone's back and forcing them to walk forward.  And that's the problem, if you commit violence or terroristic threats with a car in this ""country"" you are less likely, not more likely to get in trouble.  Insanity.  There are plenty of kind people in the not super wealthy suburbs too tho, and I feel for them.  And not everyone who is an automotive sociopath is rich and white, but I have noticed a commonality im vehicle choice.  Filthy rich to dirt poor, they fall for unreliable vehicles that project importance and aggression, which tends to be mostly Nissan and everything Chrysler, but even the new angry looking corollas are driving like bats out of hell.

The numbering can throw you off, sure. But it's less wacky than pro max plus ultimate. Pixel almost does the same thing, but instead of marking the version, the numbers just go higher each year. Tbh, theirs is more confusing.

Xperias had an alphabetical convention in the past, but somehow the new convention looks cleaner in the long run. Eventually, changes can happen, so it's probably not always gonna be like this. I mean it'd be kinda tacky to have something like, xxxviii, if xperias even exist at that point.

"~~Toyota Sienna and~~ Chrysler Pacifica are minivans available in North America as PHEV (just at a quick glance).

There are fewer wagons available in North America, but there is the Volvo V60 Recharge. 

There are presumably more available in Europe/the rest of the world and there would be more available in both classes in North America if people didn't fall for automaker marketing and move into SUVs/trucks. They used that change in market trend to justify cutting sedan, hatchback, and wagon models from their collective lineups. SUVs are not actually statistically safer than cars, they just make occupants feel safer (to the detriment of pedestrian safety and the safety of people driving normal sized cars, as SUV sizes break ""crash compatibility"" and put the cars at a disadvantage by size). Automakers have taken advantage of that mentality and pushed hard for SUVs, because cars are more heavily regulated (for safety, size, emissions, etc) and taxed. SUVs are classified as light trucks and are under much lighter restrictions/taxes, meaning automakers make a lot more money on SUVs/trucks, hence their push towards SUVs and the gutting of smaller models.

All that said, you're absolutely allowed to have a preference, everyone is. Just don't misrepresent your preference as some burden you had to bear when making your choice. There were options and you chose what you like, which is fine, that's how markets work, but you know, be honest about it.

I don't know that anyone here is going to have any ability to accurately predict when interest rates might come down.  Some manufacturers are slowly starting to offer lower promo rates, so you could research those. 

Trading it may require buying out the lease first - for a while, at least, leasing companies were not allowing leased vehicles to be traded except for their own brands (i.e., Honda Financial would not allow you to trade it in for a new Toyota without buying it out first).  Not sure if that's still a thing, but if they still have that policy, you're going to pay taxes on the buyout and then the new purchase.  You'll need to check with the leasing company to figure out your options there, though.

"While I am not anti-EV, I still think we are a ways away from them being ready for prime time.   If you travel through states that have a strong oil and gas industry, odds are you will find fewer charging stations (and those states tend to push back against tax credits.  As far as Tesla, most of companies with Musk having some control tend to have pretty poor quality assurance.  I do think we are seeing a gradual growth in infrastructure as more EV's are on the road.  And as infrastructure grows, more support needed for the industry will grow (I think the legitimate issue with what happens when batteries fail.  The replacement cost is still extremely high, and part of going electric is the need for better recycling and disposal of batteries.  Also, support infrastructure in mechanical services that are not just the dealers/manufacturers.  Granted, EV as a concept is still in the early stages, especially with traditional car manufacturers.  Odds are, assuming no major incidents or failures that would give lobby groups, corporations and certain political figures a cause to push back and hinder the progress of EVs, that a major event that needs to happen is likely some company comes up with a strong innovation that can be applied to EV's in general, something the major manufacturers do not currently have.   I also look at Toyota, who is kind of holding back on EV and investing in more hybrid models (Only a single electric vehicle which is a small SUV) vs 13 hybrid models, 11 of which are hybrids of existing models (Rav4, Camry, Corolla, Highlander, Sequioa, Tundra, etc)",0.32989404,0.6070872,0.06301876

"shop owner here. As someone who's tried many of them, CCC Online Ordering is by far the best. It's integrated in our estimating software, doesn't require extracts, shows OE options for a/m and provides price match when available. It also helps that it gives me a paper trail of what was ordered and what was processed. 

Before CCC Ordering was as ubiquitous as it's become, we used to rely on CollisionLink. Setup was a bit annoying with the extractions but the system was clearcut and worked very well. 

TraxPod was in play for us for a very short while. It was annoying to have to use a separate system for just Toyota and Nissan. Biggest problem with it was that we had to keep switching to it just for those two OEs when all of our other orders were in CL. There was also a tendency to just process the orders without checking them against a VIN. Nissan's database in CCC for estimate is especially atrocious so we kept having to deal with parts returns and the delays they cause. 

by far the worst system i've dealt with was PartsTrader. As a select service shop for State Farm, they forced us to use it and, while it actually functioned somewhat similarly to CCC Ordering, it didn't allow for limitations of vendors, so suddenly a Honda dealer 100 miles away was bidding on our orders, undercutting by a few cents and the system was forcing us to use them or waste time documenting why we weren't using them. Needless to say, placing orders across vendors scattered in a 100 mile radius became problematic and when we parted ways with SF and their select service program, i shitcanned that stupid program immediately. 

Anyway, not sure if this was what you were looking from since i'm on the other side of the aisle but happy to answer any questions you have.",0.03989449,0.28973052,0.670375

"Brother is looking for a car now that he's out of college and can afford something decent.

**Location:** US-MN

**Price range:** $20k max

**Lease or Buy:** Buy

**New or used:** Used

**Type of vehicle:** Truck/SUV

**Must haves:** 4x4/AWD, heated seats, sunroof, phone audio integration, fits a guy who's 6'6"" comfortably. Leather, Cooled seats, and remote start are a massive plus.

**Desired transmission** (auto/manual, etc): Auto

**Intended use:** Daily driver, will probably not get many miles on it, maybe 6-8k/yr.

**Vehicles you've already considered:** Ford Explorer Sport (a couple in price range from 2013-2015), Lexus RX350 (found 1 at $21k in the area), Toyota Highlander (found a few, but options are limited), Honda Pilot (not a huge fan of bodystyle), Toyota 4runner (unlikely to find in this price range)

**Is this your 1st vehicle:** No

**Do you need a Warranty:** No

**Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle:** Dad can help out

**Can you do Major work on your own vehicle:** No

**Additional Notes:** Just wondering what other options would be out there. My brother is a big guy height wise. Used to play basketball until he got diagnosed with scoliosis. Doesn't fit in cars or smaller crossovers well (my parents' old Ford Fusion and even their Ford Edge were small for him). He has an older Escape right now, but it's small, old, and rusting out with 180k miles on it.

"Hello friend - I am sort of in the same boat as you and I can tell you the results of my extensive (ask my wife ü§£) research:

1.) i am cross shopping the Santa Cruz, Tacoma, Ridgeline, Frontier, and Ranger - I feel similarly about being in between a ute and a midsize.

2.) regarding the Santa Cruz - only buy the naturally aspirated (NA) engine. Not because the turbo engine is bad per se (it‚Äôs not the best, but it‚Äôs totally fine), it‚Äôs because the DSG transmission has a lot of problems and will probably grenade eventually. With Hyundai, you just hope that it‚Äôs before 100K miles. It‚Äôs already been recalled due to an oil pump and there‚Äôs lots of reports of issues. For off road, a DSG transmission is the worst possible transmission. It‚Äôs delicate and not built for that - honestly, I‚Äôd rather have a CVT!

The NA engine has a conventional auto transmission that‚Äôs fine. The best combo for the vehicle is SEL trim w/ the activity package.

3.) the MPG for this vehicle isn‚Äôt much better than a midsize truck 

4.) here‚Äôs my suggestion:

- if you get a Santa Cruz get the SEL w/ activity package. It‚Äôll run you about $34K

- if you prefer a unibody ‚Äútruck‚Äù that drives smoother, the Ridgeline is a better engineered vehicle, with a lot of the same features (trunk in bed), and it will last *A LOT* longer. You should be able to get one for about $43K - which puts it in the upper trims of the Santa Cruz. 

- if you end up truck, I recommend 2: the Toyota Tacoma, and the Nissan Frontier. Both have naturally aspirated engines and are dependable. You can get a Frontier S Crew Cab 4x4 for about 36K. You can get a Tacoma SR5 4x4 for about $40K.

On Saturday I bought a 2019 Subaru Ascent Premium from a local Toyota dealership. So far i've really enjoyed how it drives. However, on Sunday we noticed that some of the interior panelling is coming off in a few places. It kind of looks like it was never put back properly after an inspection?  Do I have any recourse since I did buy it ""as is"", after all? All I want is for the dealership to offer to put the panels on properly. We are afraid to push them back on ourselves in case we mess something up (there are some electrical wires behind some). 

I should say that I've already sent an email about this (on Sunday) via the website contact form. I also followed up over phone yesterday (Monday) and was transferred to the used car manager. I got voicemail and he never called back. What would you recommend I do next?

They‚Äôre both essentially the same car and if you don‚Äôt care too much for the aesthetic difference then there‚Äôs no reason to not get a BRZ. Another interesting thing to note between the two is that Consumer Reports rated the BRZ 3 points higher than the GR86 in their road test score (86 vs 83, respectively).

Ultimately, if you just want this car for the driving characteristics, you should go with whatever car you feel comfortable paying/waiting for. With Subaru, you can order any configuration of BRZ with a 2-3 month wait time while paying MSRP; whereas with Toyota, you may end up waiting 8 months for the color you want and it might not even include all of the options you want, along with a 2k markup over MSRP.",0.14714497,0.6883958,0.1644592
"I've seen/read that Toyota has severely limited the production of the XSE w/PP aka ""tech package"" trim (due to the ongoing chip  shortage). We are hardly seeing them even in the U.S. and I know for a fact that Canada has way longer wait times/less inventory that we see here.

u/mrsgrigio, you mentioned that ""*we are desperate need for a larger family vehicle*"" so it doesn't seem like you have the ability to wait another 1-2 years for the CHANCE of snagging one. The XSE is a fine trim; yes, the PP has a lot of ""goodies,"" but once the auto market becomes more of a buyer's market, you could always ""upgrade"" yourself (if you &amp; your family desire). Who knows what else might be on the market by then, too?

Some information to share from a recent article:

&gt;""Automotive manufacturers are still dealing with the effects of the microchip shortage that began in 2020. Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, told reporters that he believes the industry will see 2-3 million units cut from production in 2023.""

"First of all, I just want to thank OP for putting the tracker together. This is a super appreciative function that I wish was available from the manufacturer (I've ordered other brands before and we were given direct access to detailed information about what stage the build was in).

That being said, hoping to get some feedback on experience
others are having with their build/delivery.

My Tacoma was built on 2/6, confirmed by my dealership and they provided me my VIN.

When I found this tracker, it was sitting in allocation, with no estimated delivery date. I was told it was held up in QC, which I've seen others saying similar.

About four weeks ago, I finally got movement on the tracker and it moved to freight status (yeah!), With an estimated delivery date of 3/16 - 4/13, we confirmed with our dealer the same dates.
As we were about to hit 3/16, the date then changed to a week and four days out from the current date. So when I checked on 3/16, my estimated dates were now 3/27 - 4/20.
Now every day I check the tracker, everything shifts forward one day, so as of today, we are sitting at an estimated date of 4/8 - 5/2. 

So really, I was just curious if anyone is seeing similar results, or if anyone who has now received their delivery was seeing anything similar. Just trying to get a better grasp on status since Toyota is unfortunately failing me on this info.

Any feedback from anyone is appreciated!

"Quite the opposite, success of Prius kept Toyota in a very difficult position.  When you control roughly 80% of the market, there is little incentive for others to join in.  There was a huge struggle getting other automakers to show any interest.  Toyota simply did not want to go through that again.

If you study the history, you'll see strategic moves where Toyota oddly stepped aside allowing others to get the spotlight... like Ford with their Energi debut.  The hope was success of those plug-in hybrids would open up the field to others.  So, Toyota paused their own plug-in hybrid rollout.  Most people are aware of the partnership with Tesla.  That again was a move to assist with opening up the market, beyond the reach of just loyal Toyota customers.

Learning the lesson of conquest is difficult.  We have seen GM really struggle with that.  It is vital though.  If you cannot appeal to those who already own an ICE you built, how will you break the status quo with BEV sales?  Toyota is well aware of that barrier and having others as an ally in the push was absolutely vital for the move beyond hybrids.

Enthusiasts tend to overlook clues related to the bigger picture.  As a result, ,there is a lot of spin &amp; distraction from the problem of growth once the early-adopter audience is exhausted.

"Ahh well that answers it, the warranty only covered what they deemed to be the issue, regardless what the mechanic said.

The warranty company I dealt with did that with my VVT Phaser, only replacing that even though the mechanic was saying to do the timing chain also. I bought the rest of the parts myself off eBay and PartSouq which saved me close to $1k in parts, all Toyota OEM.

Here some of the issues I had that were related to my VVT Phaser not Retarding (P0012 OBDII Code):

* Rough Idle - Whole car would shake like alignment was out/driving over uneven surfaces

* ""After Rev' - RPMs would remain high even after I put the clutch in for a second or two

* Open Valves - If I kept the car in 3rd gear especially around 3k RPMs I was able to hear the valves not entirely closed. Really should have taken a video of this for future reference.

* Jerking - When keeping around 1k-2k RPM and given barely any gas (like in a parking lot), the car would start to jerk

Again, my gear was completely seized and would not retard at all. The light did not trigger when it was just malfunctioning at first. 

Have you checked the battery harness? If the harness is locked in tight, then you need to check the plate the battery sits on to make sure that is tight also.

I would do the same with the intake and radiator. Check the mounting points as if the car has been shaking like this for long enough, possible it shook the bolts loose.

I would grab an OBDII scanner off Amazon. Even a $40.00 one will read the codes for you if/when you ever have any.",0.14048728,0.76742333,0.09208931
"Oh I‚Äôm not saying you will have problems that you are aware of within the powertrain warranty but I can be fairly certain it won‚Äôt be in the same condition at 10-18 years old with an owner you changed it at least according to the maintenance schedule used for decades prior (60,000 miles/100,000kms for most vehicles) to this lifetime recommendation. 

This widespread lifetime fluid recommendation is relatively new and I don‚Äôt think we have passed the 8-10 year mark of Toyota going to that recommendation but I could be off since I have a 2005 and cannot say for certain when lifetime came out. 

So not since lifetime recommendation has come out, I cannot recall me seeing a tear down of a transmission. But I have seen many videos of vehicles with likely lesser quality transmission than Toyota break down within 5 or so model year old. 

Sorry I cannot give specifics. I do a lot of research on and about vehicles and I can say for sure I have seen transmission breakdown due to poor maintenance but those were likely before this more recent lifetime recommendation but I‚Äôm not talking about decades ago either when tolerances were not as tight as nowadays. 

We have all heard of people with transmission slipping, etc and advised now not to flush fluid now due to them not keeping up with the fluid changes previously. 

Yes fluids are better now and the mechanicals for the most part are more advanced and depending on the brand, worse or better quality, but they haven‚Äôt improved so much that fluid is lifetime.

"Your second paragraph hits the nail on the head and is what I've mentioned on reddit a lot. There's nothing wrong with the reliability of German brands in Europe (except BMW, which is often found near the bottom of the T√úV charts and often comes up with the most questionable engineering choices. Do they still use plastic coolant pipes?). But somehow Americans get ridiculous engine failures on nearly new cars, sometimes at just 80k-100k km.

While it's true that Americans often get the bigger, more powerful engines, and sportier/more luxurious models in general, even the V8s aren't GENERALLY known to be bad here in Europe. Maybe AMGs and Audi S or RS models won't last too long, but those aren't your average grocery-getters.

And yeah, I don't know anyone who's had a good thing to say about American cars. I've owned one and it was ""meh"" at best. I fully expected it to break down every 2-3 months. People romanticize about OLD American cars, but while those have lasted a long time (some of them - most are dead), they've nearly always got very low mileages on the odometer.

And I mean Japanese cars ARE reliable, but they've got issues of their own. Often worse fuel economy AND less power than their German counterparts. The CVTs were downright horrid (Audi is also guilty of this). And have they learned to galvanize steel yet? All those ""uber reliable"" older Toyotas and Mazdas are getting scrapped in my country because of rust.

My next car is most likely going to be yet another lightly used Mercedes, or an Audi or Volvo. 3 brands I've had mostly positive experience with (though I will say that while I'd own a 00s Mercedes again without hesitating, I would NOT own a 00s Audi).

depreciation of the value of the car over the lease period, and I am   
opposed to financing as I do not want to take a high interest debt to   
purchase an asset that immediately starts losing its value the moment I   
own it.

Understand though that while leasing you are paying for the depreciation there is an interest charge applied to the lease.  Interest charges on leases are calculated differently than interest charges on financing a vehicle.  As a result, as interest rates on leases recently have increased, the total interest cost of the leases have increased substantially.  At 7.19% for your Toyota, you will pay an interest cost of nearly $10k for the 4 year lease.",0.34737173,0.62439126,0.028237006
"Connected to that: I am pissed that Subaru only sells their hybrids in a select number of states so I can't get one if I wanted one.

"Owned one for maybe 4 years? It was alright until it almost killed me.

Handling isnt amazing. Comparing it to previous Civic's iv owned (EG hatch, EK hatch, EM1 coupe) it almost tries to 'oversteer' at times without the control. Door handle snapped multiple times.. Bad design. 

In the end.. The exhaust started to blow near the back box. Which burned a hole into the boot well, which melted the hybrid battery.

Took it to Honda; not knowing why I was struggling to breath whilst driving.. when the window would fog up due to gas and the warnings said failed IMEC system or whatever it was called.. Honda told me it was a negative battery terminal causing the extreme gassing of the battery cells.. Charged me money to do nothing. Let me drive it home. It not long after broke down on the side of the motorway..

I then found it myself.. A massive hole in the side of the battery.. Stopped smoking a week prior.. Could of been killed by a hybrid. Wouldn't buy one again. Cost me around ¬£1000 to replace the battery just to get it working to sell it.. 

Looks cool.. Wasnt amazing MPG imo. My current daily is a Toyota Mark X 2.5 V6 and the MPG is almost the same imo.

"Eh, I saved a ton of money when I stopped driving. I pay about $1,000/mo to live about 2km south-southeast of the dead center of Houston. There are definitely parts of the city where I could find a place to live for more like $800, but even just the regular car costs exceed $200/mo.

The biggest issue, though, is how often cars have ""minor"" issues that cost a ton of money to fix. 

Recently, I borrowed a friend's ancient Toyota Corrola to haul some things and got hit by a cement truck. Impact was light, but it ripped the back bumper guard off. The fix? $2,700. Before I gave up on it, I was driving a car that was worth maybe $2,000, but when the transmission blew, it was going to be at least $3,000 to fix it. Two months prior to that, my AC fan motor died. $500 to ""fix"" (nowhere near where it had been before). Three months before that, spent $2,600 fixing worn out break pads and a broken strut. Throw in flat tires, broken windows, and basic maintenance, and I absolutely believe that the $10,000/yr figure is basic transportation. 

My car wasn't worth more than maybe $3k before the transmission died, and I was probably paying that much.

All of that said, you're absolutely right that **truly, comfortably** walkable places are a lot more expensive than Midtown Houston. But I also can't imagine that places like my neighborhood - tolerably walkable, solidly bikeable, decent transit, reasonably affordable - are unique in the US.",0.30386713,0.5717291,0.12440372

"Maruti may not be innovating, but their decision to partner with Toyota and bringing out hybrids in lieu of electric vehicles for near-term seems to be resonating with the buyers. The hybrids are selling like hotcakes and also offer a very strong value proposition for mass marker buyers - the ability to draw 20+kmpl mileage with zero charging time and without needing any extra infrastructure. 

I feel that the EV market is going to be niche in the near term in India as the target buyer seems to be someone who needs to run 50+kms daily and already owns one car (which is a pretty small market imo)

Kudos to Tata and Mahindra for being the first movers in EV but I doubt that will be of any advantage whenever Maruti will decide to enter the EV market, as they have a knack of finding the best product market fit for mass market buyers.",0.01572819,0.24943072,0.7348411

"Listen, if you hated the gen 3, the only way to tell is you go test drive the gen 4 (or 5). The biggest differences in the newer models are more modern features, but overall the vehicle concept is similar, and it‚Äôs not for everyone. The Gen 4 has a similar layout, but it does have a peppy Power Mode, and works for me. 

My take: 

Any hybrid or PHEV or EV like the Prius is particularly well suited to delivery driving because it gets incredible in town driving and nearly double the range of a comparable EV, which depending on your daily average driving, could require taking a break or two for recharge during your work day (not necessarily a bad thing for your physical health to have to take a half hour break every 3-4 hours though).  

Mine (gen 4, ‚Äò22) is very spacious for the class of car it is; I fit in it fine (6‚Äô, long legs) and my son, who is even bigger, fits comfortably in the back seat as well, when the front seat is pushed forward. The rear hatch opens wide, seats fold almost-flat (low ridge between seats and trunk), and I can fit a 6‚Äô box of IKEA furniture in there or MASSIVE amounts of smaller cargo. 

If you don‚Äôt like the Prius, try test driving other hybrid models like the Prius Prime, Camry or Corolla Hybrid, Hyundai Ioniq, or Kia Niro.  I can‚Äôt speak to long term reliability for non-Toyota cars. I found the Camry XLE Hybrid to be an absolute joy to drive; they‚Äôre just way overpriced where I live. 

I‚Äôd recommend a mid or top tier trim that‚Äôs more comfortable to sit in for several hours a day, and possibly go with one of the more SUV/CUV models if you‚Äôre more comfortable in a vehicle not as low to the ground; several SUVs are hybridized now, making them acceptable for delivery vehicles.  The higher trim can be useful for better rates if you also give rides on regular Uber/Lyft.

CarMax is a great place to test vehicles as they usually won‚Äôt harass you to buy, and they usually have a modest variety of vehicles that are strictly only a certain age (and usually a certain condition). It may not be the cheapest place to buy used, but they seem trustworthy.",0.17462249,0.61622083,0.20915668

Best thing to do if it's been sitting is change the pcv valve and grommet prolly all gunked up in there from sitting and short drives for so long. The grommet will break apart into the valve cover gotta pull it out try to get it out in one or two pieces mine just separated at the top and I was able to pry the rest out with some locking tweezers. Change the oil pour a small bottle of  fresh oil after the old drains out and keep an eye on the color change oil filter. Get that old gas out and change fuel filter. Seafoam in the gas tank is supposed to help the bag on the fuel pump  become more pliable. Had that small issue with the slight smoke completely went away after changing the pcv valve and a fresh full synthetic oil change. Do the oil change every 3k miles for a while. Change air filter smoke issue should go away. The seafoam will cause it to smoke a bit even in the gas tank but will go away after a while check belts and hoses fluids etc and put some miles on her. They want to be driven and oil changed frequently these cars can last forever. Most people I've seen these last until the body rusts out or they are in an accident.

You will usually not wear out oem pads on a modern car until around 100k miles. A lot of GM stuff will go well over that, some come in with original pads with over 140k miles. Hell me Cobalt was on original pads at 130k miles. 

I don‚Äôt really like machining the rotors. A lot of times cars like Toyota and Nissan have pads that don‚Äôt contact a small portion around the edge of the rotor. Rotor rusts a bit. Causes noise. Pads will be fine, but noisy. So electroplated or coated rotors are recommended.

"The most popular 7 seater SUV currently is Mahindra XUV 700. This is the best bang for buck in its price range in my opinion. The top trim is about 30 lakhs on road all included. The wait period for new is a min of 6 months and could go Upto 2 years depending on the trims and choices.

If you are ok with 5 seater hatch back or suv, the other contenders like Kia, Nissan, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota and Tata have good choices. If you go with unpopular color or less fuel efficient engine, you will get the cars in less than 3 months and sometimes under 20 lakhs.

But a wait of at least a month is standard. If you are not particular about what car you buy, I‚Äôd suggest you read reviews and book a name brand car as early as possible before you come to India. Go to r/carsindia to look at the trends.

Also setup UPI. You are dead in the water without it. Get an Indian mobile phone number. Your entire identity is associated with your mobile phone number. Create a bank account associated with the phone number. Get the Aadhar card (associate it with your mobile phone) and PAN card if you don‚Äôt have them already. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of these steps. In fact I‚Äôd suggest you travel to India first to set these up before the actual move to India. At least a few months ahead. You will need a couple of months in India to set these up. I‚Äôd suggest you very aggressively and proactively set these up. Seek help in every step of setup. Otherwise you will depend on the others for the first few months after your move, for everything including ordering take out food and that can be an ordeal.

If you cannot setup UPI, you will at least need an Indian debit card or credit card with enough purchase power in it (at least one lakh but likely a lot more to be comfortable)

If you don‚Äôt have an Indian drivers license, get the international DL before you travel. AAA will give it to you in less than half hour. I got it the day before I traveled.

Also schools in India is big business, worth thousands of crores of rupees. Any good school will have huge competition for admission, so don‚Äôt assume that admission will be easy. Visit schools during your setup visit if you can. Talk to the principal and staff.

Yea, let us depend on China more and not less. Maybe they won't invade Taiwan then...

None of which will affect prices for the consumer. Most manufacturers are already tied up in contracts spanning years too.

Old post but I think the best way to get the point across is through an analogy. High performance cars for example, are built using exotic materials like carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, that are chosen for specific performance properties like strength to weight ratio. The manufacturing/assembly process for a car designed to scream down a racetrack at 200mph is also going to be much more complicated and expensive than that of a Toyota Corolla. But you've also got comfort oriented premium products like Rolls Royce and the S-Class.

Frequently, companies decide to optimize for comfort, for adjustability... others for durability, reliability. Thus all sorts of things have to be considered to judge value. And that R&amp;D/innovation, materials, precision. features, etc. can be working towards many different goals.

"Maruti is at dead last when it comes to EVs, not too surprised with this one. Toyota itself has recently set aside their pride and made the bz4x. They were betting big with hybrids but unfortunately they never took off at least in other countries.   


Right now, its only tata, mahindra (to an extent), BYD, MG, hyundai, kia and a few luxury brands who offer EVs in the indian market. Tata is already leading the lower segments and no one will think about buying a maruti EV if brands like tata and mahindra will capture the lower end (which they already are, tata much more so than mahindra).   


For context, Tata plans to launch 10 Electric vehicles by 2025, and they are right on track presently. They already have 3 EVs running with the harrier,safar, altroz and punch EVs expected to launch sometime this or next year. The curvv EV will also launch by 2024 along with the ICE version making it the 8th EV to roll out from tata. The sierra will launch by early 2025. That makes it 9 EVs in 2025 with gen 3 products lined up for later.  


Maruti will be launching their first EV by 2025 and will have a measly lineup of 10 EVs by 2030 (which is also not confirmed) + they have almost 0 experience with EVs and so does their partner toyota (talking about full EVs here before someone brings up the prius)  


Both hyundai and Kia have great experience building Electric vehicles outside of india and they have almost no work to do so they are the ones who can wait for the market to shift that way. Mahindra has already started their work in the EV segment, BYD is the leader in terms of tech and is the tesla of China, MG has all the help it needs from SAIC. Maruti will definitely be out of the race if EV adoption increases in india which it will because EVs will offer much better value, power, reliability and cost lesser to maintain compared to ICE counterparts which are taxed to oblivion in this country.",0.40077814,0.5398487,0.059373207

My 2003 Toyota Camry is on its last legs and I‚Äôve found a great deal on a 2013 Camry that has all of the options I am looking for and for only $11,000! I would like to upgrade but want to make sure that I can comfortably afford it. 

I am currently the CFO of a major airline, my wife is the heir to the throne of Finland and together we bring in about $1.5 million per month. Her 2006 Pontiac vibe is paid off and so is our home, our kids homes, our helicopters, our yacht, and our 5 other homes. Insurance is about $80 per month for both cars and that‚Äôs our only monthly expense.

Does it make financial sense for us to make this purchase?

"Your last paragraph really resonated with me there. x

My husband and I cared for his parents and Aunt in their last years and his Mam, in particular, had very complex COPD. Sometimes there was a screaming dash to A&amp;E for low oxygen, sometimes for high Carbon Dioxide. These episodes grew more frequent, infections became ubiquitous, then we had Bi-PAP, then we chose palliation. Looking back, I have no idea how we all coped. 

One day, she took a bad turn, and quickly. We called an ambulance, but we live rurally and were advised that it would take more time than I felt we had. We piled the poor lady, oxygen, pulse oximeter, BP cuff, blankets, even a hand fan (to help her feel like she wasn't smothering) into the back of Himself's car and he drove like an actual PSYCHOPATH the whole way to the hospital. Hazards on, beeping, sobbing his eyes out.

I was in the back with my MIL, and was on the phone to the A&amp;E nurse, trying to keep an eye on her oxygen and keep her calm, while my poor Himself drove with an expression on his face that I hope never to see again.

We arrived, she was stabilised, and I rang the Garda√≠ to give them our reg and explain, in case anyone had reported us. Which they had, of course. I think the Garda√≠ must have contacted the hospital, because Himself was never given speeding points, or heard anything about it again.

So I will start working this September and was looking around to purchase cars. I will work for around 2 ~ 3 years in US and will probably go overseas in a different country for work. So i need a car for 2 ~ 3 years. I am considering a new car lease that would cost in total of $11000(including due at sign) over a 2 year contract. Other is buying a used car and selling them after 2 years. One thing that is stopping me from buying used car is that there is so much bubble in the used car market and it will probably disappear within 2~3 years. So I have take into account of the 

Used car price bubble + possible accident that would impact the car price + depreciation value + possible maintenance cost since I will be purchasing a car that has expired warranty + dealer margin when selling it to a dealer. 

  Considering that Im willing to buy a used 23k Honda or Toyota car(just for example, 6 years old 60,000 miles or something like that),

Would there be so much difference in the overall loss of my asset  value compared to new-car lease? Thank you so much.

Not Ready to Go Full EV? Some Car Companies Bet Bigger on Hybrids

https://apple.news/AhC05Bvb6SvW8yfJ33k2dJw

Toyota has said that governments aiming to cut carbon emissions should encourage hybrid sales. Last month, Toyota leader Akio Toyoda told reporters the company could make eight plug-in hybrids with the same number of batteries in a single 320-mile-range EV. Those eight plug-in cars would help cut carbon emissions more than the one electric car, he said. 

With gas prices hovering around $4 a gallon in many parts of the U.S., customers who want fuel-sipping models have been turning to hybrids. Gas-electric vehicles also are getting a look from buyers who might want EVs, but don‚Äôt live in areas with easy access to reliable charging stations, dealers and executives say.

Toyota said hybrids, including plug-in cars, accounted for around 20% of U.S. sales in September, but has said that rate could have been double if not for supply constraints.

Overall, hybrid vehicles represented 5.6% of U.S. sales through September, while EVs were 4.9% of the market, according to data from research firm Motor Intelligence.

‚ÄúIf it has a hybrid engine on it, it has a gold star in the customer‚Äôs mind,‚Äù said Adam Simms, CEO of California-based dealership group Price-Simms Inc. He estimates that he could sell 6,000 more hybrids if he had the supply.

WSJ 2/27/23.  Move Over EVs, Hybrids Are Hot in China
The success of Li Auto underlines the risks of an all-or-nothing approach to the shift to electric vehicles

Li launched two sport-utility vehicles with this technology last year, the L9 and L8. The smaller L7, deliveries of which start this week, is expected to run for about 130 miles without using the generator. For longer trips, filling up the tank extends the range to almost 700 miles.¬†

Brokerage Bernstein expects 65% growth in plug-in hybrid sales in China this year, versus 25% growth for pure EVs.

In Europe, plug-in hybrids had a difficult 2022, with sales down 3%. They are often dismissed as a transition technology that will do no more than bridge the gap between conventional cars and pure EVs. GM, Ford, Volkswagen and others have tried to jump ahead in EVs by sidelining hybrid technology.

Li‚Äôs success in China underlines the risk that this all-or-nothing approach turns out to be shortsighted. Each market will follow its own path, but it is plausible that the Chinese pattern could be repeated in the West: The first rush of EV sales could lead to a second wave for hybrid adoption as regions less well served by charging infrastructure, or buyers who drive longer distances, join the transition on terms that work for them.

It isn‚Äôt a reason to shirk EV investments, but car makers with a more nuanced approach to the industry transition, such as Toyota, could end up looking smarter than they do now.

"A few interesting facts, pulled from various internet sources: 

How much pollution does a gas powered leaf blower produce?  
""Approximately 5 pounds of particulate matter per leaf blower per hour are blown into the air and can take hours and even days to settle. This particulate matter precipitates asthma attacks, exacerbates allergies, and can cause lung cancer."" Sep 18, 2021

Roughly 30% of the fuel used in two-stroke engines fails to undergo complete combustion, resulting in the release of toxic pollutants into the environment. These pollutants include carbon monoxide, nitrous oxides, and hydrocarbons. Aside from its well-known health risks, carbon monoxide contributes to ground-level ozone; nitrous oxides and hydrocarbons are components of smog; and if that weren‚Äôt enough, hydrocarbons are also carcinogenic.  
A 2011 study comparing a consumer-grade leaf blower to a Ford F-150 Raptor pickup truck found that the leaf blower emitted 23 times the amount of carbon monoxide as the truck, double the amount of nitrous oxide, and nearly 300 times the amount of hydrocarbons. Another study found that pollution from operating a commercial leaf blower for one hour was equivalent to driving 1,100 miles in a 2017 Toyota Camry. That‚Äôs approximately 16 hours of driving, or a road trip from Los Angeles to Denver.",0.24073502,0.71771103,0.041553892
"‚ÄúTrillions in oil, refining, and ICE manufacturing assets are about to get wasted.‚Äù

They‚Äôve been talking about supposed ‚Äústranded assets‚Äù for years, but 2022 showed record profits for the oil industry. 

‚ÄúAll net new power demand is met by renewables globally, and in the US.‚Äù

Hmm, that‚Äôs a clever way to put it. But China and 3rd-world countries funded by it are not substantially ‚Äúbuying‚Äù renewables or the renewable story, AFAIK. They want the West to fund any renewables they buy, as they made plain at the latest COP in Egypt. 

‚ÄúWhat matters is what the market wants. It‚Äôs already selling 2 to 1 pure EVs versus plug-ins gas cars.‚Äù

But HEVs + PHEVs still outsell BEVs. And what the market wants is distorted by politicians‚Äô incentives, such as the tax credit for the Tesla you mentioned earlier. Looking ahead to the looming materials shortage for electric components in two years, hybrids will become comparatively cheaper and thus more cost-effective CO2 reducers. (See quotes in my other comment at this level.) This will lead regulators to adjust their incentives. 

‚ÄúToyota has made itself the Blockbuster Video of the auto industry.‚Äù

Toyota‚Äôs new Prius hybrid PHEV will sell well. Its production of hybrids is currently limited by supply chain shortages. Its monster new factory in Alabama will shortly be producing a RAV4 Prime SUV hybrid. In comparison, I just read that GM lost $3 billion on its BEV division in 2022, and Ford lost $2 billion.

"$15k will go a lot further on a car than an SUV in terms of getting a low mileage, reliable vehicle. That said, I am not trying to discourage you from getting what you want. Here are some SUVs which are known to be reliable, however finding a lower mileage one means you're going to need to look for older models (or high mileage newer models). If you can save or borrow another $5k - which I get it, is a tall order these days - but if you can, I would suggest doing so because $20k seems to be the tipping point for getting a vehicle with under 100k miles. That extra $5k might buy you more years than you expected is all I'm saying.

Happened upon a 2023 Kia Sorento Plug-in Hybrid today. These are rare around these parts and I was pretty day excited to see one. It lived up to my wife and I's expectations. So much so, I saw the sticker price and noticed they tacked on carpets and a cargo mat for $300 and was thinking w/e, I still want it. The final sticker price was $51,985, including the mat, carpet, and $450 for the red paint job. All in all, I was fine with that price.  


I walk with the sales rep back inside as they're telling me they can't sell it yet since it was brought in for a car show and they need to get insurance on it and get it out of Kia's inventory or some crap. I don't really know but it essentially isn't for sale yet but once they get it in their possession, I can take it for a test drive, which may be as early as tomorrow. The rep also mentioned with this specific car, it's almost first come, first serve.   


My wife and I wait at the table for the final OTD price and this is where the fun stopped. $59,495.75; a $7,510.75 increase from the sticker price. Here's the list I see on the OTD price.  


* Sticker price with paint and mats: $51,985
* Protection Package: $3,085
* Total Purchase: $55,070
* Dealer Administration Charge: $699
* Georgia TAVT: $3680.75
* Non Tax Fees: $47
* Balance: $59,496.75

The TAVT and Non Tax Fees are unavoidable. I'd either be paying them at the dealership or at the DMV so I'm fine with those. My gripes are mainly the Protection Package and the Administration Charge. If I weren't being charged for either of those, my TAVT would only be $3,431.01, saving me $249.74, as well as the $3,784 of crap I shouldn't be charged for in the first place.  


From what I've come to understand, the Administration charge is essentially the dealership getting the car ready, like a carwash and removing plastic and other shit. It's stupid but pales in comparison to the Protection Package. I won't post all of the details but this is what it covers, taken straight from their website.  


**Benefits of Paint Protection Scotchgard**

**Benefits of Fabric Protection** 

**Benefits of Key FOB Replacement**¬†

**Benefits of 3M Door Edge/Cup Wear Tear Guards\*** 

**Benefits of 3M Lifetime Tint\***

**Benefits of Powertrain Limited Warranty**  


All of this is stuff I don't want or care for. My rep was honest and told me it's being forced because this is such a ""hot"" item and, more of less, the full sale of the protection package ensures they make a good profit off the car. Essentially, it's only there because it's a hard to find car and it's their way of marking up the vehicle. The only way any of it can be negotiable is if the car has been available on their lot for 10 days or 2 weeks (I forgot which one).

Keep in mind, this was the second dealership I've been to looking to buy a new car. I went to a Toyota dealership and they told me they couldn't remove a $75 cable package for four USB cables. The Toyota dealership didn't force any insurance package but they told me they couldn't remove that, a $75 charge for 6 gallons of gas (seriously, wtf is that?) cargo mats, and that paint coat crap.

I'll still want to take it on the test drive and see if I can negotiate. I'll still reach out to other dealerships to see if they have any available and what the OTD price is. The question I have, and I'm pretty sure I know the answer, is about their Protection Package. How much of it is bs and is this price for their protection insurance overpriced? Also, is the $3,784 markup of dealership crap a lot? I know it's not a great time to be buying cars but with everything going on, is this a fair price for the markup and a brand new car?

Simply put they would have to take a loss on your van. I am at a very big dealership group and the manufacturer is Toyota so this doesn‚Äôt happen often but it HAS happened before.

"I agree 100% that Tyler Reddick will be a Cup champion before he retires and probably a multi time champion. He has always been fast, no matter what kinda car or truck he sat in. He was a Scott Bloomquist protege when he was 14 years old and Bloomquist maintained Tyler's car at his shop and also supplied him chassis. Tyler won East Bay during Speedweeks for the Lucas Oil Series when he was 14 and he was so tiny that he had to use a small stool outside his drivers side door to stand on so he could slide in. Youngest winner at East Bay speedweeks ever and that was against Bloomquist, Moyer, O'Neal and all the best dirt LM drivers. 

He won titles with RCR and JRM in back to back years. He had a big hand in turning RCR Cup cars around last year and he will keep winning at 23XI. Imagine him in a Hendrick car!!! 23XI is great equipment but they're still young. Reddick in an HMS car would look like Larson has at HMS. Reddick, like Larson, is a generational talent and Denny knew it. The best way to find out just how good an athlete is at his/her sport, ask their peers. Reddick's peers all brag about how uber talented he is. He and Christopher Bell will keep Toyota afloat this season. Ty Gibbs will have a learning curve but zero top 15's the first 4 races this season to now scoring back to back top 10 finishes shows us that he is adjusting well.

"It was just a bad idea that you tell her to refill the coolant without knowing the cause of the overheat.... it's ALWAYS  a BAD IDEA without knowing the cause since the more times your overheat... the greater the chance of damaging your headgasket. Even just one overheat can a damage your headgasket of your engine. It could be a leak at the radiator, hose, water pump leak.... overheats can be cause by a stuck thermostat, a fan relay not going off, etc..

Just curious what year, make , model is your car?

Anyway, here's a good video on headgaskets issues from Faye Hadley:

[https://youtu.be/brLmBRYSb\_E](https://youtu.be/brLmBRYSb_E)

In testing your car for a headgasket issue ..... you can do a combustion leak test:

[https://youtu.be/v0U8Iyf0kk4](https://youtu.be/v0U8Iyf0kk4)

&amp;#x200B;

Now if you do have a headgasket leak now... and depending on the age of your car... and miles.. might be worth it to try a sealer ... Personal I would do it the way that described in Faye Hadley's video....  pull out the spark plugs and the times he said to re-torque the head...

&amp;#x200B;

last method I would do is Scotty Kilmers way,,,

[https://youtu.be/X0EdjDmfu8k](https://youtu.be/X0EdjDmfu8k)

Anyway, the car shouldn't have been driven til it was properly diagnosed to find out the cause of the overheat....

so it's not her fault at all.. but you should have told her don't drive it and taken an uber/lyft.

As for no heat if you turn on the car.. that probably means either air in side the system or no enough coolant..

.... you might have a leak somewhere. that you have to address.. radiator leak, hose leak.... etc..

also note: has the car ever overheated since you have owned it and how long have you owned it?

Anyway, to properly fill up the coolant and burb the system... please watch this video from Faye Hadley on a coolant flush.. the methods in this video can help you refill the system and properly burb it..

[https://youtu.be/jFB\_adKLmPg](https://youtu.be/jFB_adKLmPg)

For future wise on future cars as they age....  as preventative maintenance  you should probably change out your upper radiator hose and lower radiator hose every 5-8 years and tension clamps... radiator every 8 to 10 years... Water pump every 120K-180K miles. Thermostat every 5-8 years... to avoid overheating your car..

I just changed out my radiator hoses on 2014 Subaru Outback and thermostat.. Car has 125K Miles.. Water pump was also changed for other reasons..

2005 Toyota Scion tC 171K miles.. need to change out the entire coolant system... Radiator, hoses, tension clamps, thermostat, water pump and thermostat... will do that in the up coming weeks to avoid  leaks....and aging parts..  I really don't want an overheat.  Will probably replace the fan relays too..

"According to the affidavit, the person who reported him missing had searched the bathroom and noticed blood smeared on the door, a stall and the bottom of a toilet. Police said Cozzi had left behind his wallet, car keys and cell phone. He was in the process of responding to an email and music was playing from his phone.

But he was never seen exiting the building and left behind his vehicle, according to police.

‚ÄúDuring the investigation, there was a strong chemical odor in the men‚Äôs bathroom of the office and small drops of blood,‚Äù Largo police said in a statement. ‚ÄúA subsequent forensics investigation revealed a significant amount of blood in the same bathroom.‚Äù

The building‚Äôs surveillance cameras captured a Toyota Tundra arrive at Cozzi‚Äôs office around 8:32 a.m. the day of the supposed murder. Moments later, a man identified as Kosowski was seen entering the building, wearing a backpack and gloves, and carrying a large box.

Five minutes later, Cozzi arrived at his office.

Around 10:22 a.m., Kosowski was seen leaving the building in different clothes. He was pulling a cart that contained a red bag or blanket, which he was struggling to transport to the Tundra.

Police said their telephone hearing was supposed to begin at 10:30 a.m. Kosowski attended the hearing from 10:28 a.m. to 11:04 a.m., but Cozzi did not show up.

Their investigation led police to obtain a search warrant for Kosowski‚Äôs Tarpon Springs home, which he bought in 2018 for $1 million, according to public records.

Evidence obtained from the search warrant ‚Äî the nature of which has not yet been publicly revealed ‚Äî led to the vehicle stop of Kosowski on Saturday, police said.

The body of Cozzi, 41, has not been located at this time. The investigation is still active and ongoing.",0.23652098,0.74890625,0.014572833
"Nice! Livery and decal making is one of my favourite parts of Forza! And I‚Äôve been a gearhead since I was little so I‚Äôve got the benefit of being familiar with automotive branding! This stuff is super interesting to me so I love explaining whenever I get the chance!

So Ralliart is the performance division of Mitsubishi. Basically they‚Äôre a wing of the company that focuses specifically on their performance models and they‚Äôre exclusive only to Mitsubishi. The idea of a manufacturer having a special tuning division is pretty common. To give you some examples:

Mitsubishi - Ralliart

Subaru - STI

Toyota - TRD / Gazoo Racing

Lexus - F Sport

Mercedes Benz - AMG

BMW - M division

Audi - RS

Volkswagen - R Line

Ford - ST/RS (previously SVT)

Dodge - SRT

etc, etc. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre familiar with some of these performance divisions and you can see the pattern here but basically, these divisions are owned by their respective brand and of course, are exclusive to them as well.

"Rod knock. Bought it from the previous owner that way. They had all the maintenance records, and all maintenance done at a Toyota dealership except for one entry at 114k miles for a timing chain replacement. The technician noted at the time the oil pickup screen was filled with sludge and that he cleaned and re-installed.

My guess is sludge caused the premature chain-wear and the root cause was never addressed, causing the engine to develop rod knock at 182k.

All maintenance was done on time, at the Toyota Dealer. Even the final oil change at 181k miles, 1k before I bought it said ""customer states engine making a loud knocking noise, scanned car no codes, could not reproduce.""

"As someone who thought they'd never drive a minivan, just get the minivan. Buy for the family you want, not for the family you currently have. Unless you're one and done, or strictly planning to have a 4-5+ year gap between kids (in which case, older kid would be front facing by the time baby is born and eliminate a lot of the carseat space shuffling issues), a minivan is likely where you're heading. Yeah, a lot of people make due with an SUV, but it comes with a lot of headaches. Also, do you have or want pets? Factor that into the equation as well (not gonna lie, our dog is a big reason we just upgraded to a minivan. With 2 rearfacing carseats, there's no room for him to ride in the SUV anymore). 

As for vans, I personally went with the Toyota Sienna. I live in a snowy, mountainous region with traction laws so needed AWD (the only minivans with an AWD option are the Sienna and the Chrysler Pacifica). I also really wanted a hybrid to cut down on fuel costs and the Sienna is the only one where you can get a hybrid and AWD in the same vehicle (with the Pacifica, you need to choose hybrid or AWD, but you can't have both). Of the big 4 on the market, I think the Honda Odyssey has the best seating arrangements (Magic Slide), Pacifica has some of the best features (plug-in hybrid, all seats stow flat into the floor, cameras so you can see rearview carseats on the media console), and Sienna has the best appearance and the combinations of AWD and Hybrid (as someone who swore she'd never drive a minivan, I like that if I'm tired, I'll occasionally see Siennas (2021 and later) on the road and be like ""oh that's a kind of cute SUV. No wait. Thats a minivan""). Plus it's so incredibly quiet and zippy. It definitely drives more like an SUV than a minivan.",0.17798454,0.61938137,0.2026341

"I think most SUVs could work for plus-sized parents, depending on what carseat you get. I'm not plus-sized, but my entire extended family is. They've all been able to comfortably sit in the passenger seat in front of a large, rearfacing convertible carseat in my Dodge Journey when they've come to visit.  

But are you planning to have more kids? If so, I know it hurts, I've been there, but just get the minivan. I always swore I never would. But with 2 kids came the necessity. And we owned a 3 row SUV beforehand. We thought it had 3 rows, it would be perfect for kids. And the dog could still have his own row! Wrong. Once we installed that 2nd carseat, we lost access to the 3rd row. Even if we had carseat friendly tilt, it wouldn't make a difference, since both of our kids will be rearfacing for years to come. And if we had the 3rd row up, we'd have no room for a load of groceries, much less 
baby's stroller and the diaper bag and all of the stuff kids come with. Our dog hasn't gotten to go on a family outing since before baby was born last May because we just didn't have anywhere to put him in the car.

After almost 16 months of waiting, we finally got our Toyota Sienna on Friday. And holy crap. So. Much. Space. I can move the captains chairs all the way up to touching the front seats or all the way back to touching the 3rd row seats, so you would have all the room in the world to keep you comfortable.

The Bronco seats were tremendously more comfortable than the runner, the engine actually had guts, and the removable top was a treat.

I don't miss the tall feeling on the Bronco, the climbing up and in, or the stupid side opening gate.

There's a good Tinker's Adventure video comparing his FJ to a Jeep, and he has a chart showing the idea of ""Reliable vs Rugged"". Depending on your driving conditions, you may need one more than the other.

If you're wheeling hard enough to break your UCAs, you actually need something more rugged. That's where the Jeep shines, and where I think the Bronco is made to compete.

"&gt;bah non parceque le principe de base, la raison premi√®re qui fait que l'hybridation fonctionne/√©conomise de l'√©nergie en voiture, n'est pas applicable en avion. Ont te l'a expliqu√© en d√©tails avant.

Mais c'est √ßa que vous ne comprenez pas...

**M√™me dans le cas d'une voiture les √©conomies d'√©nergie entra√Æn√©es par l'hybridation ne sont seulement celles li√©es √† la r√©cup√©ration de l'√©nergie lors du freinage (√©nergie cin√©tique), ni seulement du fait qu'un moteur hybride arrive √† couper la combustion du moteur essence quand le moteur √©lectrique a assez de couple pour avancer la voiture tout seul.**

L'hybridation dans une voiture permet par exemple, comme dans les moteurs hybrides Toyota, de basculer le moteur du cycle Otto vers cycle Atkinson de fa√ßon √† augmenter le taux de combustion dans le cylindre ce qui  augmente le rendement √©nerg√©tique en contrepartie d'une perte du couple qu'est compens√© par le moteur √©lectrique du syst√®me hybride.

Vous ignorez aussi le fait qu'un moteur √©lectrique a √©norm√©ment plus de couple qu'un moteur essence pour r√©gimes de rotation bas. Un syst√®me hybride, tel que celui-l√† de Toyota, arrive √† profiter de ces courbes de couple diff√©rentes entre les deux moteurs de fa√ßon √† augmenter le rendement global du syst√®me par rapport √† la vitesse de roulement souhait√©.

Vous ignorez aussi le fait qu'un syst√®me hybride tel que celui-l√† de Toyota n'a plus d'embrayage ce qui augmente aussi le rendement du moteur. Le fait de ne plus avoir embrayage est un choix technologique rendu possible par la combinaison du moteur essence avec deux moteurs/g√©n√©rateurs dans un sch√©ma hybride parall√®le/s√©rie.

Vous ignorez aussi qu'un syst√®me hybride, tel que celui-l√† de Toyota, n'a pas une bo√Æte de vitesses. Le syst√®me hybride fonctionne comme une bo√Æte CVT √©lectrique capable d'un num√©ro presque infini de vitesses. Autrement dit, l'hybridation permet d'adapter le couple du moteur de fa√ßon optimale, et continue √† n'importe quelle vitesse de roulement de la voiture et cela augmente le rendement de la voiture.

Tous ces am√©liorations sont importantes et contribuent √† une meilleure efficacit√© √©nerg√©tique d'un moteur hybride dans une voiture. Dans le cas de l'avion, je suis bien √©videmment d'accord avec vous que l'hybridation fera peu de sens pour r√©cup√©rer l'√©nergie cin√©tique dans l'avion lors le freinage, mais comme je l'ai d√©j√† essay√© d'expliquer mille fois, cela n'est pas le seul gain √©nerg√©tique que l'hybridation permet faire.",0.11927345,0.8022297,0.07849684

"When people think of the supra they think of the A80 supra which is a legend and the disappointing A90 supra. But most people have forgot about the A70 supra.

The A70 supra generation is when the celica and the supra became separate models so it is the first non celica supra. It shares all the characteristics of the A80 supra but it's just an older car. The A70 supra had amazing sounding inline 6 engines. Overtime the car would get more powerful and the 7M-GE engine was switched to the 1JZ-GTE.

Late model A70 supras were the best supras. The already good 200hp became 276hp with the 1JZ-GTE. Pair that with rear wheel drive, a manual and the decent weight of the car and you have a great car you can absolutely throw around corners.

The 1JZ-GTE engine is also a very well built engine and is capable of handling 700hp with stock internals. If you tune an A70 supra well it can become an absolute beast in a straight line and corners.

The car also had a beautiful and simple design. And always looks good no matter what year it is. It has simple yet stunning lines and pop up headlights which makes a great combo. The back window curves outside the body of the car into the edge of the fenders which also contributes to it's great design.

The driver focused interior has all of the controls on the driver side angled towards the driver making you feel like you are piloting a jet instead of driving a car. Another reason it should be more appreciated.

because toyota messed up the 2019 A90 supra we have to look at the past generations to find a good supra and we can't just ignore all the supras for the A80 supra which is in high demand by JDM heads.

"&gt; Is it possible that software is not like anything else, that it is meant to be discarded: that the whole point is to always see it as a soap bubble?

--Alan Perlis, quoted in [SICP](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-6.html)

Thinking aloud here: software is unique among engineering disciplines in that the result (what we do) is decoupled from the implementation (how we do it) along multiple layers:

1. End use vs. maintenance: maybe only mechanical engineering comes close for the way that two products can do approximately the same thing but be worlds apart when it comes to fixing or modifying them (working on a Honda or Toyota : working on a Peugeot or BMW :: working on Kernighan/Stevens/Bentley source code : working on some ungodly proprietary thing someone hacked together stoned)

2. Short term vs. long term: perhaps in no other discipline do people ignorant of the discipline exercise so much control over it. This truncates the expiration date of most code significantly, and means almost nothing (even the most beautifully written and immaculately tested software) ships without needing updates almost immediately

3. Lack of standardization or a governing body: what other discipline has anything analogous to the sheer variety of languages and frameworks? what other discipline is so easy to break into that you have teenagers competing with seasoned veterans? A similarly low barrier to entry would certainly degrade medicine, law, carpentry, plumbing, etc. in many ways, while possibly injecting new ideas and innovation in other ways. But the cost-benefit analysis for these fields is skewed by the penalty for failure (lawsuits, criminal prosecution), hence they're more strictly regulated and the outcome is more predictable; but since bad code generally doesn't have such lethal or legal consequences, there's no incentive to police it harder.

Per the Perlis quote, I think software is unique among disciplines in that it almost always needs to be changed by default because what it models is so dynamic. It therefore shouldn't surprise me (although it still does, because I'm dumb) that something so objectively mutable by nature will also be inevitably provocative in more subjective ways.",0.38055,0.585703,0.033746984

"Oh no, I‚Äôm not gonna argue with you. I‚Äôm being completely honest and factual when I say only about a quarter of the people I live and work with can live with an EV as an only vehicle. 

It‚Äôs not even remotely a debate. Three quarters of us the people I live and work with use trucks for work and play.

Second, finding a Toyota dealer who sells new Corollas for MSRP is way more difficult than you make it seem. I live in Dallas, Texas, a major American city, and yet none of the dealers in my city sell new Corollas for MSRP.

So OP paying 24k out the door for a lightly used newish Corolla is not as crazy as it would have seemed even a few years back.

OP, I would choose the 2020 Corolla LE because it has the more fuel efficient valvematic LE Eco engine and also has 7 more horsepower. Plus because it's the LE, it will have smaller wheels and more tire sidewall which means better fuel economy and a more comfortable ride. 2020 Corolla also has apple carplay and a better infotainment touchscreen.

"It all depends on how comfortable you are with towing heavier weights with your RAV.  If you look at my other comment under Newprophet, you can get an idea of what the RAV Hybrid is actually capable of.  Me personally, I feel comfortable up to 3,000lbs at interstate speeds in my RAV.  3,500lbs if I‚Äôm going to stay under 50mph and less than 10 miles.  

With the camper being 1,550lbs, that will be empty.  Loading up food,water, and anything else, I would say you are going to be closer to 1,750-2,000lbs.  As others have said, the hybrid has a transmission and oil cooler, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about overheating too much.  It is all up to you with how comfortable you are with towing heavier loads.

Toyota only makes a 4-pin connector for trailers, and even at 2,000lbs, that won‚Äôt be a problem for the RAV to stop without the trailer brakes.  There are some posts in forums showing people wiring up a 7-pin connector to get that trailer braking.

"Just to comment on the hybrid point, I feel it‚Äôs not so much to do with petrol ban since it‚Äôs in 2030 if it actually happens, and they don‚Äôt really want these ‚Äòhybrids‚Äô either (their plan for Europe is EVs)
1) the EU fleet avg CO2 emissions standards of 95g/100km under the new WLTP cycle by 2024, and they‚Äôve been lagging badly even in terms of hybrid (with mostly 12v or 48v ISG belt-driven mild hybrid, and only one full hybrid by themselves in Europe) - hence it needed the Swace hybrid and Across plug in hybrid from Toyota to lower the avg (otherwise ALL of their own ‚Äòhybrid‚Äô are above 95g/100km). In the new 2030 business plan they outlined that they‚Äôll scrap all micro hybrid in place for ‚Äòstrong hybrid‚Äô (full hybrid). This likely would mean that manual cars will be eliminated (tho can do what Honda did with the IMA - high voltage parallel hybrid, motor only for assist and CO2 emission won‚Äôt get that low - if it happens I‚Äôm buying one)
2) the Euro 6d temp (by Sept 2020, followed by Euro 6d final in Jan 2022) is a lot more strict on NOx and PM, plus the WLTP cycle, I suspect K14C won‚Äôt meet these requirements. 
3) their first EV for Europe is planned next year and their plan for Europe is 5 EV models with 80% of the lineup as EVs by 2030 (they‚Äôre developing a system with a chain driven gearbox to compensate the uphill&amp;high speed performance&amp;efficiency of small motors). Think they themselves also noticed they lagged so much behind in terms of hybrid like Mazda (their full hybrid Vitara has the almost the same consumption &amp; emission to their mild hybrid‚Ä¶), but need to bring these mild hybrid out (cheap&amp;easy to do) ASAP to fill the gap till then and avoid fines‚Ä¶ so in short ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt like them either‚Äô is what I feel. 
That‚Äôs said the new SSS is said to be out this summer with the normal Swift. I highly suspect it won‚Äôt be a EV but a hybrid, hopefully it will be at least a much better iteration of hybrid (and not crazy priced)

"There is another important factor. Glickenhaus had problems at the SC restart, the car started doing really slow at the Wec pit entry creating a gap between the leading cars and the Lmp2/Ferrari 499P.

Toyota immediately noticed and made an early SC restart on the Ulman straight to create a big gap with the Ferrari.

With the rest of the field blocked behind Glickenhaus, the Toyota were able to put a 18 seconds gap with the car #50. Without the Glick reliability problem, Ferrari would have been much closer to the Hypercar fields

Long story of it is:

I was in a Toyota tundra. Driving in far right lane of 4-lane highway that had construction, so the shoulder was very small (not enough for a full size truck).  I looked down to try to change the station on my HT, I looked back up and the car in front of me that I was following too close swerved just in time to miss a full sized dolly (idk if they have another name). I tried to swerve but couldn't miss it entirely. My driver side ran over it, it caught the underside of my metal side step, and launched about 15 ft into the air. I was going about 70 mph so I couldn't watch it through it's entire flight but I saw a small car approaching. 

Next thing I know, a small sedan is approaching very fast, windows down, pointing and yelling at me. We pull off the highway, I inspect my truck and there is significant damage to the driver side rear door and quarter panel. The dolly flew up into the air and smashed into his passenger side engine compartment. There was significant damage. Had it hit his windshield directly, I don't even want to think about it. He calmed down after he realized the dolly didn't fall out of my truck and that it damaged my truck, too.

"I actually opted for the extended warranty (bumper to bumper 100 mo. / 100k) which was around $2995. Why did I decide to purchase it? Well it‚Äôs my first manual car and I wanted the ease of mind for potential failures on my end, in the event that it does happen then these repairs are covered. No I‚Äôm not tracking the car or doing anything crazy and the car will be kept mostly stock for the length of my ownership. 

I did ask them if I decided to opt out from it and apply for it later, would I be getting the same price and length of coverage? They said that since it would be classified as a used car, coverage would be 60 mo. / 60k for roughly 4K-5k (don‚Äôt remember the exact price). 

I also opted for the tire/wheels insurance which was $1600 for 7 years. The only reason is because in the event that I buy after market wheels/tires and as long as the setup is not touching the wheel well, those are also covered! Replacements/credit is given for any repairs that cost more than $40.

2. For new tires : You can get Goodyear tires and service from Walmart auto center. Make sure you buy tire warranty ( only $10 extra/tire ).

3. For oil change: you d only get Full Synthetic oil ( you can buy them from Costco ) . Do it yourself or take your car to Walmart and let em change it for you. ( labor cost ‚Äòs only $20-30) . Actually, if you don‚Äôt know how to change oil.. then don‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ just take your car to local shop with your own full synthetic oil..Avoid going to places like Jiffy Lube.

"Yeah, I can't say anything about the diesel models, but the regular gas models with the red block engines are very reliable. They do have their issues, mainly electrical and PCV issues from what I have experienced with the 3 I have owned. I have owned one with under 100k miles, one with right around 200k miles, and my current daily driver is sitting around 320k miles. They have all been very solid, and have never left me stranded (except for a dead 8 year old battery once, but that is my fault). 

I will say that when you drive a 240, you will need to be able to fix small issues that will constantly arise. Such as tail lights that will be giving you issues constantly, fuse panels not making good contact, and other small issues like that. You don't need to be a mechanic, but you should know how to do some basic work, or learn quickly. If you keep up with it, they won't bee too big of an issue, but if you neglect it, they will add up quickly. Parts are easy to find and pretty cheap for the cars, and they are easy to work on and forgiving, so they are great cars to learn on. But if you want something that you are going to hop in and drive without a single issue for years on end, get a 90s Toyota corolla or something 

The timing belt doesn't need to be changed every 60k miles. you would probably be fine going over 100k before having to do it, and it is NOT an interference engine, so if it breaks it will leave you stranded, but it will NOT damage the engine at all. That being said, I still wouldn't just wait until it breaks because that makes things harder. (I am again referring to the standard red block engines, I don't know about the diesel models)

Also, I don't know where the idea that ""The automatic transmission on the Volvo 240 is not known for reliability"" came from. All 3 of my cars had an auto, one had the BW55 and the other two the AW70. They are both very solid transmissions if the fluid is kept clean. Everything on the car is known for it's reliability, it is sort if it's thing. My 92 has around 320k miles on it, and the automatic transmission still shifts very smooth and works perfectly, and I don't expect it to fail any time soon. That car wasn't even maintained too great. That being said, it is common for these to shift slightly rough, especially 1 to 2 shift. It is normal, as long as it is not excessive and does not indicate a failure. As long as the fluid isn't very black or burned, it will likely function for many years and miles to come as long as it is maintained well.",0.17663148,0.6019151,0.22145344

"Almost got a 2006 corolla before i bought my first car, the older hondas and toyotas are indestructible if taken care of lol. So far I‚Äôve got ~33k miles and theres been a couple things that weren‚Äôt major but still ridiculous to need done to a brand new car. Ive had the battery start melting on me where it spewed battery acid out the top / side of the battery, the transmission mounts needed to be completely replaced, seems to be a big issue with the new gen corollas. Ive got something going on with the suspension where it seems like one of the components is wearing out / breaking but every time i take it in im told nothings wrong with it. Then theres just small stuff like a bumper clip popping off the front bumper again and again, the rubber around the top of the windshield kind of split in 2 down the middle at the top, and is slowly ripping more and more rubber off the entire top end of the windshield. There was also a ball joint / cv joint or something similar that needed to be replaced out of nowhere. Just alot of small and mediocre stuff that adds up to be pretty annoying over time. The only thing my old 2007 ford needed done was a transmission fluid change, new spark plugs and small stuff like a turn signal light and back license plate light needing to be replaced.

"Mais vous n'arrivez pas √† imaginer √† une hybridation qui fonctionne sur un principe diff√©rent de celui-l√† d'une voiture !??

Par exemple, l'hybridation peut permettre de faire sauter composants d'un moteur qui entra√Ænent beaucoup de pertes. C'est d√©j√† le cas d'un hybride Toyota de 3eme g√©n√©ration qui n'a pas d'embrayage ni bo√Æte de vitesses.

Dans le cas d'un avion, l'hybridation peut permettre, plein de choses, par exemple, un meilleur rendement du moteur essence en utilisant la propulsion √©lectrique comme compl√©ment ou m√™me permettre compl√©ment couper le moteur essence quand l'avion atteint vitesse de croisi√®re . Il pourrait aussi, par exemple, permettre l'am√©lioration du rendement du syst√®me √©lectrique d'un avion, car l'√©lectricit√© ne serait plus produite par des g√©n√©rateurs auxiliaires attach√©s au moteur principal mais directement par une pile √† combustible fonctionnant √† hydrog√®ne bas-carbone.

"El tema esta en la cantidad infernal de letra chica. Me explayo porque tuve el mismo razonamiento que vos, emperradisimo con un 0 hasta que averigue en profundidad y lei todos los contratos y entendi que efectivamente son una estafa consolidada.

-Junto con el plan siempre te enganchan un seguro de la concesionaria, que suele ser una poronga y muchisimo mas caro que un seguro normal, la tasacion de ese seguro esta a merced de la consecionaria,  no podes cambiar de seguro hasta que termines de pagar, tenes que pagar independientemente de que lo tengas en la calle o no, por lo que siempre te van a abrochar por el lado del seguro.

-Cada cuota tiene un monton de gastos adicionales (como el ""costo de administraci√≥n del plan"") que depende de la consecionaria puede o no estar atado al valor del auto, por lo que lo pueden subir indiscriminadamente y abrocharte por ahi tambien. La cuota que te menciona el vendedor siempre va a ser la cuota ""pura"", sin estos gastos ni los impuestos. La cuota real es considerablemente mas alta.

-cada cuota paga un porcentaje interesante de impuestos que claramente nunca baja ni te mencionan (por esto el estado no regula estas estafas - se llevan una buena tajada)

-Todas las leyes al respecto de estos planes estan en un gris, por lo que la concesionaria puede hacer b√°sicamente lo que se le cante el orto con respecto al plan ( como cambiarte el color, el paquete del coche, cambiarte el modelo por uno mas choto o uno mas caro y hacerte garpar la diferencia, o directamente no entregarte el auto en los plazos establecidos, todas estas cosas pasan MUY frecuentemente) y b√°sicamente lo unico que podes hacer es gatillar una fortuna en un boga y esperar ganarles la pulseada.

Claramente los vendedores NUNCA te van a mencionar todo esto (lo que efectivamente los vuelve una estafa por omision) , te mandan a leer el contrato ""estandard"" en el sitio de la marca pero ese contrato tiene mil anexos y ""updates"" que lo vuelven muy confuso y que les permiten hacer todo lo que te comentan aca.

Buy the car and relish the fact that the car market is so insane that a leased car can *appreciate in value* and pay less than you would for the same car if you were buying someone else's leased car Toyota directly.  Then you can either feel good that you got a crazy deal on a good used car or you can sell it back to Toyota or anyone else for a profit, but that leaves you without a car in an inflated market.  

If you love the car, buy it--there's never been a better time to do a lease buyout and the dealerships know that.  All the local dealerships were begging me to turn in my car and start a new lease, which is what I did when I went from leasing a 2017 Rav to a 2020 Rav, because at the time that made financial sense, but this time around the absolute insanity of the market is giving people who leased before the pandemic a financial advantage.",0.23854877,0.5761128,0.18533847

"You are trying to mixing and mashing things together to make an argument but it is not working.

Manufacturing costs are not the only costs to a product. You also have a lenghty and costly research and developement phase. You don't sack your entire workforce after you reveal a device. So Apple has every right to manufacture a device as cheap as possible while maintaining their quality goals. It's ""THEIR"" device.

Same process also applies to a carmaker. They develop their product, go through several phases and decide on a price that usually covers the cost of a single unit and leaves a bit profit.

So as you mentioned, let's look at a demanded car shall we?

Toyota asks 37-38 grand for a GR Corolla. That price includes the material cost, labour cost, r&amp;d cost per unit and Toyota's own profit. They all can manages to fit that in this price.

Odds are, everyone would be fine. 

The awkward thing is that they got crucified in the press and in court for *knowing* rather than for relative risk.

If you focus on ""knowing"" then you merely disincentivize finding out about stuff like that.

In terms of real fatalities you were less likely to die in a pinto than in most of it's competitors.

&gt;Perhaps the most illuminating data comes from NHTSA fatality rates per million vehicles for 1975 and 1976. In the published chart, the Pinto is responsible for 298 deaths per million cars in 1975, making it on par with the Chevrolet Vega (288) and Datsun 510 (294), but considerably safer than the Datsun 1200/210 (392), the Toyota Corolla (333) and the VW Beetle (378). In 1976, the Pinto‚Äôs 322 deaths per million cars was slightly higher than the Chevrolet Vega (310) and AMC Gremlin (315), but better than the Datsun 510 (340), the Datsun 1200/210 (418) and the VW Beetle (370).


The board members were probably safer being driven round in that pinto than if you'd picked one of their competitors cars and loaded them into one of those.

The car itself wasn't much more dangerous than the competitors, presumably the competitors merely put less effort into investigating possible risks to drivers/passengers and so didn't end up with any damning memo's about drawing the line anywhere on safety vs cost.

&gt;when they spend millions on bearcats


So do most police around the world, here in NZ the Police just replaced our Holden Commodores with Skoda Superbs.


The police haven't released the pricing but it's estimated that the fully equipped car was in excess of $150,000 ($100,000 USD).


We don't have the need for Bearcats but the armoured Toyota Land Cruisers that our armed offenders squad uses cost $400,000 each.

Couldn't find a single article on that. What i could find was that they operate AR-15 .223 rifles.



&gt;Hell, again my cities police department just requested DOUBLE their budget to buy an entire new fleet of vehicles with the only difference being... A new paint job. $256mil on a new paint job. 



No, its because they are operating 12-year-old vehicles, not because of a new paint job, a nice way to twist why they are buying new vehicles with a strawman. 


Here in NZ police vehicles don't do more than 100,000 km and are sold to the civilian market after their nearest service to 100,000km. That means here in NZ our police cars last 5-10 years depending on the role of the officer.

"AWD is really handy to have honestly. Just remember that while it can keep you from getting stuck as easily and helps find traction in icy conditions when accelerating, it does not help you stop faster. I got into an accident with an idiot who slid through an intersection who immediately jumped out of her Escape and exclaimed ""My AWD didn't work! WTH!!!"".

Anyways, if you're buying used, go Japanese. Honda, Toyota, and Mazda will be the most reliable, Subaru and Mitsubishi not being too bad either. The Civic, Corolla, Camry, Accord, Mazda 3 and 6 are all very reliable, solid sedans, and newer Camry and Mazda 3 models come with optional AWD. The Subaru Impreza and Legacy all come with AWD standard (and it's an excellent AWD setup honestly). Reliability is still pretty good, but not quite as good as the previous 3 manufacturers.

I like smaller cars, but if it's going to be your only vehicle, going with a small crossover SUV isn't a bad idea, as that extra bit of ground clearance (however small) can make a difference in deep snow. The Toyota RAV4, Honda CRV, and Mazda CX-3 and CX-30 are all solid choices and all have optional AWD.

As for what to avoid (especially used) I'm not the biggest fan of Volkswagen. If you're going used, their interiors and driving dynamics will be nicer than most of the other options, but long term reliability isn't as good, and maintenance and part cost is expensive which doesn't make a lot of sense for an economy car. Nissan can also be very hit or miss depending on the model. Their CVT/automatic models that use a Jatco CVT transmission can be very spotty reliability-wise. If you're buying a manual they should be fine.

TLDR: AWD is worth it if it's in your budget. If you're going used, and are planning to keep the car long term, buy Japanese.",0.10856429,0.44821227,0.4432235

Ever-resourceful Toyota has found a new way to squeeze more life from tried-and-true nickel-metal hydride battery technology, giving hybrid vehicles a new lease on life.

"This is the third time I've posted this in as many weeks:

&gt;First of all, no one actually knows if the 24 redesign is actually coming. Internet rumours are one thing but there is nothing official from Toyota. Period. You're planning your life on speculation and clickbait. That's a really shitty way to plan anything.

&gt;If the redesign actually happens, you won't see them hitting dealer lots until winter 2023. Like December winter.

&gt;If they actually do hit dealer lots, do you think you'll actually get one? The first round of trucks will go to YouTubers, aftermarket vendors, store GM's, and media. The ones that show up available will be over MSRP. If you buy a truck over MSRP you're a clown and I actually hate you and your entire bloodline. PS, I get paid on front end gross of these trucks, including over MSRP, and I would still hate you for it. 

&gt;If you find one at MSRP you will not see it until spring 2024, at the earliest. And this assumes you don't give a shit about colour, trim, or anything other than getting one. 

&gt;If you've seen half the issues I've had new Tundras come back with, you'd be hesitant to buy a Toyota ever again, let alone the first model year of anything. 

&gt;If you're dead set on buying a 24 redesign, expect to be making payments on a truck that spends a not insignificant amount of time at the dealership. You think parts shortages are bad now? Wait til literally none of the OEM vendors have even built spare parts for your truck because they barely tooled up in time for the first run of the new truck itself. 

&gt;If you want my actual advice, lease a 2023 now. If you like the new shiny thing and want to get one right away, your dealer probably at least tries to get you a truck. You are giving them back their truck when you get the new one. If the new one sucks, buyout your lease and keep the 23. If you want a new one but are slowly realizing the first model year is going to suck, you have up to 5 years to build equity in your 23 and get cheaper payments on the new truck. Cuz guess what? It's also going to be way, way more money

&gt;Long story short: the first model year of any new vehicle is just like pre-ordering videos games. Don't. Fucking. Do. It.

"They were not ""pushing"" much, the SC went out literally 5 laps in the race. If anything the #50 was under attack from the 8 and 7 already, and the 51 had fallen behind after failing to take position at the start of the race.

Molina said on the interview that both cars came in for a splash of fuel, likely Ferrari wanting to go off strategy to avoid battling Toyota on track directly.

On lap 34\~35 most of the LMHs running normal strategy came in while 51 and 50 were able to stay out, and at the end of lap 36 both Ferraris were in fact leading 1-2.

Then on lap 37 the #25 GTEAm had a puncture so Ferrari called in both cars again, likely anticipating a FCY. Pretty sure you aren't allowed to pit under FCY anymore starting this year? So it could be that it's Ferrari not wanting both cars running out of fuel during the caution (if it ends up taking a long time), especially seeing that they should be near the end of their stint. So they pulled the cars in and gave them a scheduled fuel stop perhaps a bit early.

Hence why they're back to 6th and 7th in class again after the FCY ended, because nobody else in the LMH class pitted during the lap 37 caution.

Basically they were trying to go off strategy at the start and a unfortunate caution an hour later sort of foiled their plans.

In any case, these are all expensive cars. As I said before, you're paying for whats under the hood rather than the interior quality. If you're worried about cost, but still want a sport car, look no futher than a used Mustang or Camaro if the practicality of a hatchback isn't a dealbreaker.

I personally dont see the value in the Circuit Edition. But I do see SOME value in the Morizo but its too high of a premium for what is essentially minimal chassis strengthening, where the biggest differences between all 3 trims are the tire choices used for each (if they all have LSDs). The extra 1psi the Morizo has is only to market that higher 20lb-ft of torque to further justify the added price increase. Which the ECU has already been cracked so adding boost is but a reflash away, so the power difference is going to be irrelevant.",0.060668312,0.6388224,0.30050927
"I'm not 100% sure what you're trying to argue. 

Ford got crucified for not acting on everything they *knew*.

The car itself wasn't much more dangerous than the competitors, presumably the competitors merely put less effort into investigating possible risks to drivers/passengers and so didn't end up with any damning memo's about drawing the line anywhere on safety vs cost.

In terms of real fatalities you were less likely to die in a pinto than in most of it's competitors.

&gt;Perhaps the most illuminating data comes from NHTSA fatality rates per million vehicles for 1975 and 1976. In the published chart, the Pinto is responsible for 298 deaths per million cars in 1975, making it on par with the Chevrolet Vega (288) and Datsun 510 (294), but considerably safer than the Datsun 1200/210 (392), the Toyota Corolla (333) and the VW Beetle (378). In 1976, the Pinto‚Äôs 322 deaths per million cars was slightly higher than the Chevrolet Vega (310) and AMC Gremlin (315), but better than the Datsun 510 (340), the Datsun 1200/210 (418) and the VW Beetle (370).",0.55675286,0.42523274,0.018014405

"While I do think Zane is the crown jewel of Ford development right now, it seems a bit crazy how he is frequently forecast to Cup with 11 total xfinity starts. And essentially none since his 10 JRM starts in 2019. Do you think this is simply due to the lack of quality Ford Xfinity rides? Granted Toyota is in a similar boat of essentially just having JGR. 

While I don‚Äôt dispute that Harrison was rushed along, I also wonder if Zane is that elite of a talent to leap frog an entire series to Cup. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd put Zane above a Reddick or Byron as a prospect. 

Reddick ran almost 3 full truck &amp; almost 3 full Xfinity seasons pre Cup. Didn‚Äôt win in Cup until his 94th start in a better ride than WBR.

Byron was rushed along about as quick as Burton, granted with better results in the lower series, and didn‚Äôt win for 2 and a half years in Cup in a premium ride. Much better ride than Burton.

"I have season tickets at 121. I enjoy them a lot. 4th year in section 2nd year with same seats. 

Over the last few years have seen a game in all the sections besides the ultra premium, field seats, lodge box, etc.

C5 side will give you free food but how much are you eating those hotdogs with those 7:30 to 10 PM games. For me who can easily eat before entering the stadium, not a lot. Might be different for you. 

If you like sitting in the sun you will have more opportunity to do so in C5. I would wear a brimmed hat as the sun can get in your eyes. Baring a 10 AM kickoff to avoid heat stroke, the 120 section is always going to be shaded from the sun, besides maybe the first couple rows for a noon kickoff. I am melanin deficient and I don't like applying sunscreen so the shade of the Westside a big plus for me.

The C5 seats are newer, but not the newest. Gets you right down on the field where the 120 is up a little higher so the path to locker rooms has space under the bleachers. Different viewing experience. 

What do you have the money for and what do you want game nights to be like, should be your considerations.

"Yea, I've said in other threads before that I can afford one now. 

But my limit is the interest rates. I can't justify buying a brand new car in this economy when I know once the market recovers - the depreciation hit is going to be far far worse once those interest rates come down to what I am used to. 

For me, my bank can give me 5% currently based on the info I gave them without them doing a credit check (I have a good relationship with my loan officer). Even at a 5 year term at that 5%, a Core edition with Performance Pack has an MSRP of $37,505 according to Toyota's website for me. At 5% interest, plus the 6.25% vehicle sales tax in Texas, I'm looking at roughly $5300 in interest payments making the total price $45k. 

If this was 2019 when I bought my newest vehicle, my interest rate was just 0.9%. 

Taking that 0.9% for the same GRC, interest is just $975 and total price being $40k OTD. 


Refinancing can be an option when interest rates decline, but thats still years in the future and doesn't remove the interest that was currently paid when my rate was already 5%.

I own Engage paddles and I'm super aware that they are great with their support of their paddles.

What you don't have knowledge of is the current state of manufacturing features and materials and how several brands are bringing new technologies and better materials to market at pricing nearing **HALF that** of the Engage Ultra paddles.

Engage and Selkirk are masters at coining technology names for features that really aren't any different than anything else provided.  It's just that some people eat it up.

"Haven‚Äôt seen a chr blow a tranny before and really doubt it happens at 100k considering the powertrain is almost identical to that of a corolla which I have seen running like new at 200k+ but either way you shouldn‚Äôt have to baby a car to make it to 100k. 100k is not even the break in period for most Toyotas and that‚Äôs even with abuse and poor maintenance. And if a sports car, especially one that sells like crazy, has been out for more than 10 years, shares an engine with a number of other models that sell way more units, and is marketed as a track ready car, and comes with a free track day and NASA membership cannot survive a simple track day in stock form, they screwed up. That is not abuse. That is poor design and/or poor quality because that is what the car was designed to do. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre expecting a minivan to tear up the road course. You should be able to drive the car daily for over 200k and go to the track a few times a year without ever having any significant issues as long as you follow the manufacturer‚Äôs recommended maintenance. You can do that with practically any Toyota, even the ones that are not sports cars.

It is true that many people with the first gen were young kids who had no idea what they were doing and would abuse them. Most failures on those engines were due to improper lubrication. Running a huge oil cooler and extremely thick oil is just a band aid to a design problem that is inherent to the engine. Supposedly they have made many improvements to the lubrication system on this generation but now they have the rtv issue which has yet to be officially addressed. How does something so critical and incredibly simple and easy to correct go unnoticed and uncorrected? That‚Äôs just low quality. Subaru has been known for being extremely hit or miss with engine reliability for ages and it all stems back to the base design for their engines.  I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre still miles ahead of any domestic or European manufacturer but Subaru is pretty bottom of the barrel in terms of quality when it comes to the Japanese brands. I love the car but I was always a little wary about the reliability. Supposedly since they fixed so many issues on the new gen and the rtv is something that I can address I am considering buying it but I have no doubt that if I treat a corolla the same exact way it will last longer even though I also question the quality of the new M20a engine and the cvt‚Äôs.

"Sometimes I wonder if it's just me. I have no luck with dealerships and haven't in years. I demand straight facts. Out the door prices. I want the car I want, not the other one or one just like it. If it's used, I want the car history. I also want to take it somewhere else to have it inspected.  Then I really piss them off when I tell them I don't want financing and I won't pay their Admin or Signing Fee.  The last time I agreed to their admin fee, I told them that I too charge the same fee for administration on my behalf.  I guess they are used to folks who just walk in, do what their told, sign their lives away and think they got treated well.  Truly, I try not to be an AH when I am there but I always feel like I am being treated like an idiot or a jerk.

**Writing**
Gyaos was created as a response to Toho's Frankenstein Conquers the World and The War of the Gargantuas. Yuasa pitched to writer Niisan Takahashi an idea to turn Dracula into a kaiju. Yuasa approached the film like a children's book, after feeling that children became bored during the human scenes of the previous films. Yuasa held a meeting to discuss how to jump into the action scenes as quickly as possible to retain children's attention. The film's opening was inspired by real volcanic eruptions from the Philippines, Indonesia, and Kamchatka that were happening at the time of production, with fears that Mount Fuji would become active. The expressway protest was inspired by the Sanrizuka opposition against the construction of the New Tokyo International Airport.Producer and senior managing director Hidemasa Nagata wanted to include the protest because he found societal issues made films more interesting. Nagata also wanted a correlation between the protest, roadblocks, bid hike, and Gyaos' awakening, stating, ""I want to let the children know that there were consequences for doing bad things."" In an early draft, Takahashi used the working title Gamera vs. Vampire. Gyaos was named ""Vampyra"" and stood 67 meters high with a wingspan of 172 meters. Nagata coined the name ""Gyaos"" for the monster. Yuasa ""hated"" adding scenes with military and scientific figures on the film, and other films as well, feeling that the characters were ""useless"" but seemed obligatory due to the 1954 film Godzilla.On Eiichi's role, Yuasa stated, ""we wanted all the ideas to come from the child. It may be a bit silly but we didn't want theories of the adults to work in the Gamera universe"". Yuasa made Eiichi point out Gyaos' nocturnal nature, feeling that it was a detail only a child would notice. Yuasa felt one of the film's messages was to show the purity of children, stating, ""I think the main point of the whole film is that Eiichi and Gamera had some sort of bond or one mind. I thought that was better than some needless exposition."" The car split scene was added after Takahashi saw the Toyota Corolla deluxe at a motor show, as a result, the vehicle was not produced for the film.

"My understanding, from reading different things over the years, is that:

1. (as you said) the engines aren't all that different; which makes it easier to scale up for heavy trucks
2. the clean-burning of hydrogen with only water vapor as a byproduct (ignoring what it takes to generate the hydrogen
3. over reliance of hydrogen being ""the most common element in the universe"" hiding the fact from the public that free hydrogen isn't that common on Earth and must be generated/extracted by complicated means.  At least the acid methods that fueled the hydrogen balloons from the 1600s-1940s wasn't revisited.
4. a low energy density compared to gasoline or modern battery tech, meant short ranges with larger, heavier storage tanks
5. Toyota's assumption starting in the late 1980s that battery tech wasn't going to move at a cost-effective level beyond lead-acid in the timeframe that it would take for hydrogen logistics to become widespread.  Add with that, the ability to fast-charge batteries.  It's still not fast enough for many consumers' needs, but it's well above the ""trickle charge"" rate of Power Wheels and Tyco RC vehicles in the 80s and 90s
6. the inability to create an affordable plug-n-play device so that gas stations could generate their own hydrogen on-site.  Personally, this is what I think killed it off for good, because without this step the logistical nightmare of a completely incompatible fuel type/generation/storage/regional-disparity would doom commercial proliferation.",0.20111732,0.7424861,0.056396496

It's 56.5mpg for the 'Sport' and 'Advance' versions** with their larger 18-inch wheels, variants which record 113 and 114g/km of CO2 respectively. Either way, that's in the same ballpark as this model's closest rival, the 2.0-litre Hybrid version of the Toyota Corolla (which manages bests of 57.6mpg and 111g/km of CO2). -[RAC](https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/car-reviews/honda/civic/civic-e:hev/)

"&gt; Edit: to visualize why this is true, picture your car sitting between two SUVs and ask yourself if a person sitting inside the car several feet back has a better view than a person that's sitting outside on the car's bumper. The camera is basically a person sitting on the edge of your bumper and always has a clear view.

Backup cameras are great, but they tend to be mounted very low and far back. Even with a fish-eye lens, it a fairly limited arc of view behind the car. It doesn't pick up approaching cross traffic from the sides, especially if they are close My two eyes, mounted high up on my swiveling neck, still work better.

The ones with side-scanning radar do work better, though.

"About ... Wow, 70 years ago, in the UK, motor cycle companies were selling their expensive models.

In came Honda and Toyota. They sold their tiny 50cc machines and cheap 125cc.

Of course the British manufacturers scoffed. How could they not. Who would want a cheap machine when you could own a proud expensive machine like theirs.

The thing is: People could afford those Japanese machines.

And whilst they broke down or didn't have the power of the UK ones (Not always true but still a factor) they were almost as cheap to repair and accessorize.

So accessories were made. Mods were designed and Toyota and Honda racked it in and brought out better models, cheaper models, more popular models. What's more the people who bought the expensive machines realized those manufacturers ALSO made those and they were now popular enough to be cheaper to repair.

It doesn't matter how good your product is, how much better, how much easier to use if nobody is using it.

Sony shot the Vita in the foot when they brought it out with the price point.

Your points are all valid but it didn't matter because nobody (Ok it wasn't a flop, it just wasn't a success) bought it and therefor nobody made games for it and the cycle continued.

15 years later you and I can compare them objectively but the amount of support of the PSP is miles ahead of the Vita and since the Vita is an EOL product it probably won't change.",0.2648475,0.58447605,0.15067647

"***What are some of your favorite dependable resources to learn and get informed in this whole process of purchasing a vehicle?***

There really is lot of conflicting information out there. But some sources are actually really good. I'll list off a few and a my reasoning behind them.

**WEBSITES FOR CAR RESEARCH**

[https://www.consumerreports.org/](https://www.consumerreports.org/) \- There's alot of car review websites that publish their content for free, so many people ignore consumer reports because it has a fee. In my opinion, this fee is more than worth it because Consumer Reports goes above and beyond when testing their cars and tracking the reliability of models over time. There's also a tool that helps you search for used cars in your area, and it will link their review under next to each car so you can see what they think about it. There's also a search tool where you tell them what kind of car you want and what characteristics are most important, and it will list out some options. Overall, the fee is worth getting consistent, long-term car reviews. Other sites tend to have pretty inconsistent criteria for their car reviews, and since they're funded by ads, could possibly be influenced to give a sponsor's car a better review. CR is funded by subscriptions and donations.

[https://www.carcomplaints.com/](https://www.carcomplaints.com/) \- This site allows you to search for a model and year, and it will list out the most commonly reported issues for that car.

**RESOURCES FOR CAR MARKET RESEARCH**

[https://caredge.com/](https://caredge.com/) \- This site is ran by a former car dealer and his son, and they have almost daily updates about the state of the car industry. They also have several video and article tutorials on how to buy a car, negotiate, and make sure everything is in place to make your purchase. Ray has a lot of practical advice and experience that was really helpful in my search. Their YouTube channel is just as good, maybe even better.

Ben Hardy, Aubrey Janik, Lucky Lopez and CarQuestionsAnswered are a few channels that stay on top of the car market, and give practical advice when it comes to understanding how much a car is really worth. They don't always agree, but their insights are helpful.-

**YOUTUBE CAR CRITICS / REVIEWS**

Although the Consumer Reports articles are great, it's natural to want to watch a review and see the car in motion and explore the interior. There are many, many car critics on youtube, and some are better than others. Here are some of my favorites.

[https://www.youtube.com/@DougDeMuro](https://www.youtube.com/@DougDeMuro) \- Doug DeMuro is a certified car nerd. He has so many reviews it's hard to believe. As a critic, Doug leans a little optimistic in my opinion. He really loves cars, so you'll get a detailed review, but he isn't super harsh in most of his reviews.

[https://www.youtube.com/@AAutoBuyersGuide](https://www.youtube.com/@AAutoBuyersGuide) \- Alex on Autos also produces pretty detailed car reviews.

[https://www.youtube.com/@TheCarCareNutReviews](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCarCareNutReviews) \- Car Care Nut is an independent Toyota/Lexus specialty mechanic, but he's recently started reviewing other cars. Unlike most channels, he's more than willing to go under the hood and critique the design of the powertrain.

**YOUTUBE CAR CRITICS / REVIEWS THAT I DON'T RECOMMEND**

Honestly, you'll probably be fine watching most reviews for the car you're looking at. But there are a few popular channels you'll likely run into that I don't recommend you take their reviews too seriously. They're not BAD channels, but I do think they're inconsistent critics.

[https://www.youtube.com/@scottykilmer](https://www.youtube.com/@scottykilmer) \- Scotty pretty much invented the genre of Youtube car videos. He's a (semi-retired?) car mechanic who reviews the cars that he fixes, and over the years he's reviewed alot of cars, but his true love will always be Toyota. Scotty is very engaging and entertaining; his reviews are snappy and to the point. But he uses alot of clickbait and doesn't seem to do much research on the cars he reviews, so he'll often critique a car for an issue the brand had 20 years ago, which has no bearing on the car he's currently reviewing. His documentary style videos are pretty good though.

[https://www.youtube.com/@ECPP](https://www.youtube.com/@ECPP) \- Exotic Car PlayPlace, like Scotty, is very entertaining and generally makes engaging content. But seems to do very little research before praising or criticizing a car. On top of that, his videos are extremely inconsistent. He has no problem making a video about ""Cars with the Worst Engines"" one week, then make a video two weeks later with the same car that called ""Is \_\_\_\_\_ more reliable than a Toyota?"".

"Hello! Roughly the same age as you and also recently a first-time buyer. 

I'm just going to tackle these one by one because I've had all of them myself. 

***What has covid done to car buying that has made it harder when it comes to getting a vehicle?***

I'm gonna try to keep this as short as possible and not give an economics lecture. But there's a little bit of lore here. In early 2020, when the pandemic was new and not well understood, car manufacturers and dealers decided to heavily limit their operations, expecting a large decrease in demand. Manufacturers cancelled their orders for parts and chips (which require a decently-sized lead time to produce). On the dealer side, however, the decrease in demand was very short lived, due to the dealerships adapting to the situation and getting creative, like making virtual showrooms and delivering the car to the buyer. So demand for vehicles returned to a somewhat normal level by the summer of 2020, but the supply chain had been disrupted significantly by the pandemic and the manufacturers cancelling orders on parts. Luckily, there was still quite a bit of inventory to go around.

This leads into the second consequence of covid on the car market: stimulus checks. With Americans getting 2-3 large checks in the mail, many decided that the money would make for a good down payment on a new car. And the dealerships were more than happy to accommodate this increase in demand, often selling new, expensive cars to people who normally wouldn't qualify for a loan, but can make a large down payment with the stimulus checks. Between Summer 2020 and late 2021, new car inventory evaporated and production couldn't keep up.  Dealers started marking up new cars several thousand dollars over MSRP. Yet, there was still demand for cars. The demand would then shift to used cars over the same period of time, which would lead to markups on THOSE too. 

Both of these issues came together and made 2022 a very difficult year to be a car buyer. Inventory on new cars was low and used cars were overpriced. MSRPs have gone up at least 10% across most brands. And we're still feeling the affects of that today, especially with the possibility of a major recession.

***Is the market going to get that much better that its worth waiting?***

Lots of people claim to know, but nobody really knows for certain what's next for the car market. Several analysts were predicting a decrease in used car prices in 2023, and they decreased for a bit, then started increasing again. Car dealers and manufacturers are now aware of how much people are actually willing to pay for a car, and have realized that they've probably been underpricing their inventory for a long time. I don't think we'll ever see a pre-2020 car market again. That said, I don't really know either, anything is possible lol. New inventories are steadily increasing for certain brands though. Stellantis (Crysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram) cars have always had good supply. Mazda, Kia, and Hyundai are starting to build bigger inventories now. It's still a bit hard to find Toyota, Honda, and Ford dealerships with high inventory. The main benefit of waiting would be for you to save more money and increase your purchasing options. Though, a 20k budget is alot higher than most of the people on this sub usually have.

***I'm open to any car brand that has a good reputation.*** ***The only things that I really want in my new car are for it to be a full size sedan, smooth ride and quiet cabin on the highway, and comfortable seats. Any suggestions? My budget is around 20k, preferably less if I can get away with it.***

You're a rare breed. Full-sized sedans have become really unpopular in the last few years. There's nothing wrong with them, but Americans love their SUVs. Because your budget is fairly large, and you're not looking for a Pickup or SUV, you've got ALOT of options. Instead of reccomending individual models, I suggest you get a month of Consumer Reports digital (10$) and research some cars there. They have reviews of pretty much every major car that's come out in the last 20 years, and keep track of their reliability over time. As far as good reputation, Toyota and Honda realistically have the best reputations right now, especially as other manufacturers are phasing out their sedans. New generation Kia and Hyundai sedans (2020+) might be a good option too, as they have improved their powertrains from last generation.

***Is buying a car online a viable option these days?***

It's certainly an option, and lots of people have done it. There's technically two kinds of ""online car buying"". There's buying from a dealership, but just negotiating the whole thing online. Then there's using a dedicated online service, like Carvana or Carmax. There's pros and cons to each. 

Buying online from a dealership doesn't guarantee that you get to avoid their games. They'll still find a way to adjust the price so that it's not what was listed, even though you're buying online. But, in the event of an issue, you still get the benefits of knowing where the physical dealership is and having recourse. There also might be some incentives, depending on the dealership and how much they want to move their inventory. You can also test drive the car, and just buy it online later once your mind is made up. 

Buying from a service is way more convenient, and the listed price is usually what you pay from what I've heard. The tradeoff is that quality might be a little less consistent, because these services were really eager to take trade ins during the peak of the used car shortage. There's not as much quality control as a dealership that takes more time to inspect and repair the used cars they get from trade ins and at auction. Also, if there's an issue, I hear it's difficult to get these services to do anything about it.",0.04360361,0.76434565,0.19205076

"Merci de l'info, je suis curieux de l'√©lectrique et regarde souvent les articles et essais d'automobile propre et la chaine EV.

Globalement, mon inqui√©tude n'est pas sur le trajet d'un point A √† un point B, globalement, sur les grands axes on trouve de quoi charger.

Par contre une fois √† destination de vacances, c'est l'organisation du s√©jour qui ""m'inqui√®te"". On est du genre √† bien aimer vadrouiller et de mani√®re plut√¥t spontan√©e. 

Exemple, on part faire un road trid Normandie - Cotentin - Cote de Granit Rose, on r√©serve les couchages et ce qu'on fait de journ√©e se d√©cide de la veille pour le lendemain. Avec une voiture thermique, pas besoin de se soucier de la jauge d'essence, faire le plein c'est une fois tous les 600-700 bornes et √ßa se fait en 5 minutes. Si dans la journ√©e tu d√©cides de faire une boucle de 400km, il faudra in√©vitablement partir en qu√™te d'une borne, le temps de charge du r√©seau auxiliaire (supermarch√©s, places de village) est d√©j√† plus al√©atoire (tout comme le fonctionnement de ladite borne). Et je ne parle pas de la fois o√π, dans les C√©vennes, j'avais essay√© de recharger mon PHEV, √ßa n'a jamais march√© sur les 4 bornes du village. Pareil lorsque nous avons vadrouill√© entre le Lot et le Massif Central, aucun super chargeur √† des centaines de km √† la ronde.

Et lorsque je liste toutes ces exp√©riences, je suis aussi conscient qu'il y a charge map, ABRP et autres, mais pour √™tre serein, il faut plusieurs cartes de recharges diff√©rentes (toutes ne fonctionnent pas sur toutes les bornes), un peu de chance, une planification qui rythme le s√©jour et les visites.

D'un point de vue un peu craintif, j'aurais tendance √† croire que finalement, la marque qui permettrait de rouler le plus sereinement, au niveau planification parfaitement int√©gr√©e et r√©seau de recharge, ce serait Tesla. Malheureusement, lorsque je vois le bilan qualit√© et le SAV de la marque (sans compter que la concession la plus proche de chez moi est √† 1h30 / 140 km de chez moi)...

C'est pour cela que je reste aussi attentif au thermique, globalement moins cher √† l'achat et, pour le moment encore, plus simple en mobilit√© globale.

Je serais potentiellement tent√© par Kia Ceed SW, mais le commercial, fort honn√™te, m'a clairement dit qu'avec mon kilom√©trage, il faudrait faire deux vidanges par an, donc en coup d'entretien, il serait aussi cher que Toyota et plus cher que BM (c'est un peu un comble...)

Il y a forc√©ment des concessions Peugeot, Renault, Citroen dans ma r√©gion, j'ai toujours bien aim√© le compromis comportement routier des Peugeot, ma compagne a une 208 que je trouve nettement plus confortable que mon X1 tant en sellerie qu'en amortissement.

Je suis plut√¥t neutre vis √† vis de citroen, √† mes yeux ce sont des voitures ni moches ni superbes. Si j'ai bien compris, la seule motorisation essence disponible quelle que soit la gamme c'est le 1.2L puretech, plut√¥t sympa et sobre mais qui serait probl√©matique question fiabilit√© et endurance.

J'aimais bien Renault aussi, mais la concession de ma r√©gion est affubl√©e d'une bande d'incapables √† l'atelier (et je p√®se mes mots) et mon dernier achat chez c'est TRES mal termin√©. (forc√©ment quand ton moteur s'√©teint sur l'autoroute √† 110 avec un message risque de casse moteur alors qu'elle sort du garage pour une intervention en garantie sur ledit moteur, ils ont entendu parler du pays et ont du reprendre leur tas de boue et me rendre mes sous).

Pas de garage Skoda √† moins d'une heure de route, une concession Audi, mais ils sont puants d'arrogance et de suffisance... (J'aime pas quand un vendeur te toise et te m√©prise quand t'arrives en T-shirt-jean-basket et quand il voit que t'as un porte clef BM d'un coup se met √† faire des courbettes)

When the van died for the 4th time this morning, I emailed the gentleman at the dealership and he said he‚Äôd like us to consider trading the van back into them for a different vehicle. 

We are in need of major guidance on our rights/next steps in how this sort of situation will go. 

We put 7k down on the Pacifica and financed the rest for a purchase price of $26k. We did not buy a warranty but the dealership offers 6 mon limited warranties on all their used cars. 

The dealership has two vans that would even be comparable at this time. 

1. 2015 Town and country L touring won‚Äôt 73k miles with less bells and whistles but one owner, no accidents $15k
2. 2017 Toyota Sienna awd with 69k miles, minor accident on carfax but features in line with our Pacifica $29k

Price range: =&lt;$30,000

Lease or Buy: Either

New or used: Either

Type of vehicle: Prefer a sedan, crossovers and compact SUVs are fine

Must haves:  Looking for something that drives smoothly and quickly for my needs. Fuel efficiency is a must. AWD is preferred but not needed if the car handles well.

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc): Automatic

Intended use: Daily driver and weekend

Vehicles you've already considered: Honda Accord/Civic/CR-V, Subaru Crosstrek, Toyota Camry/Corolla/2023 Prius, Mazda Miata/Mazda3

Is this your 1st vehicle: No

Do you need a Warranty: Preferred but not necessary

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: Sure

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: Probably not

Additional Notes: I'm basically just looking for something that can drive me to college, my friend's houses, stores, parks, etc comfortably while still being fun to drive. The Crosstrek is my favorite but I hear the CVT is jerky. I also like the Accord and Camry. Although it wouldn't be my first car I'm still new to driving.

"Yes you can‚Äôt for certain vehicles. You can do that for Lexus, Toyota, Mazda, Subaru (depends on the years), some Fords, etc. BMW, Mercedes, Audi fall under the you can‚Äôt category. Anything over 5 years old for those brands, you can‚Äôt predict based on carfax alone. Engineering is the big issue, specifically quality control and design. What that means is you can‚Äôt predict that the bmw you‚Äôre looking at has a defective headbolt due to a manufacturing flaw. Service records tell you nothing about this. But bmw did have that issue and it has affected 2006-2015 approximately. Plenty of other manufacturing errors/design flaws that the engineers (I work very closely with bmw) know but can‚Äôt do anything about it, that make it their way to the vehicles. People still buy, so if there‚Äôs still profit, then there‚Äôs no point in fixing the issues‚Ä¶.I can see why management tows this way. If you get the issue, well it just sucks, just like the timing chain issue you got. Toyota, Lexus make it a point to minimize these types of issues, quality control is their top priority. For 2018 and above BMW has improved quality control and manufacturing, not on par with Toyota and Lexus but much better than pre-2018. That‚Äôs why the newer bmws have very good ratings, and if you really want a bmw, I can only recommend a 2018 or above.

You have a Toyota they have some of the lowest depreciation of any car brand. When you trade it in instead of being 15k negative you'll be 25-30k.

First off, I will be talking about some bad financial decisions. I am very young, and have very limited experience with big purchases. I know I messed up. :(

Back in September, I bought a Toyota Tacoma SR, 2wd, with the 4 cylinder engine for 35k. It had less than 500 miles on it. I put 3k down, and financed the rest. It came out to 45k, I financed it with Toyota. I make payments of 770, later this year I will switch the gap insurance to my actual insurance provider, and it will go down to 670. Every time I make the payments, I cannot help but to think that for not much more money, I could probably have gotten a newer truck that would retain its value better. I started looking around, and saw that some GMC dealerships in my area (Katy/ Houston) have the GMC Sierra Pro for 41k and some other variations of the Sierra 1500 for 45-46k. After doing some trade in value estimates, I have calculated that I would have about 15k in negative equity that would rollover into a new car loan. If I get a new Sierra 1500 for 46k, would the value of the truck outweigh the extra 15k+ that would be rolled over into the loan for it?  Is this a terrible idea? Should I just try to pay my Tacoma down?

I just feel like if I have to pay down a 45k+ loan, I want it to be for a car that will still be worth something in 5 years. I am confused about which car will be worth more in 5-10 years.

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I also really like the look of the LC 500, my main concern with this car is that it would attract too much attention. As for the Solara, I've seen them driving around and like the way they look.. plus they're cheap and seem easy to find.

In the market for my first car (22 m, if relevant) and I've found two Toyota Yaris that have a good service record. Here are the details.   


Dealer A: Closer to home  
Asking $15K | Mileage 72.5K | 1 Accident | XLE Model  


Dealer B: Out of state (300 miles), will deliver for $500  
Asking $15K | Mileage 41K | 1 Accident | LE Model

&amp;#x200B;

Would dealer A be willing the price down by $1-1.5k if negotiation happens with respect?

Even Toyota didn't have that access when they entered the US market in the late 50s. The solution, partner with individuals (dealers) all over the country. Toyota even partnered with distributors (GST and SET), so not only does Toyota have dealers, but they have a second layer of distribution that's adding $2k-$3k to the cost of every Toyota on top of the dealer charges for much of the country.

You can still buy a single cab long bed truck, and even a single cab short bed if you want, extended and crew cabs have just got a lot more popular and with that bed length is usually shorter to fit better in garages and parking spaces.

"With Toyota you will get the Vehicle Stability Control light and Traction Control light on (means they‚Äôre ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù) Whenever a check engine light occurs. For example on my 2003 Highlander I had a check engine light come on because of the EVAP system (emissions) which then shortly after cause both my VSC and TC light to come on. This happens to spook you into fixing it ASAP. I‚Äôm going to assume they came on close together so I‚Äôm that case your VSC light shouldn‚Äôt be of worry since your check engine light is just for Coils. Since you did not notice loss of power, misfires/weird vibrations it‚Äôs safe to assume your coils are most likely fine. Their are two sets of the same P0352 code. If it is primary then it‚Äôs an issue with wiring, short/ground. If it is secondary it is an issue at the spark side. For primary look at all grounds ensure there is good contact and if the surface is rusty clean and reconnect, check for damaged/exposed wires and connectors replace/repair as needed. If it is instead a Secondary code check all coils for cracking broken connectors and any abnormalities. I‚Äôd also check spark plugs to ensure the gap is right and for wear. Make sure there is no oil on plugs. If a spark plug has a very large gap replace. If you just replace it‚Äôs coil it will blow up the coil again. Easiest way to not diagnose? Just complete a full tune up plugs and coils after checking wiring and then see if anything happens. Getting to the rear coils is very easy. Hardest part of that process is getting the rear bolts out of the bracket that holds the power steering lines. Just have a weekend todo a few beers and take your time.

"There's cars like that everywhere, from every automaker. Names don't always translate across multiple languages and cultures. Names that might be available almost all over the world sometimes are trademarked in a few countries and have to be changed in those places. Names might have a rude connotation in one or two countries. There's actually not that many cars that have the same name everywhere they're sold. Chevy builds a small SUV called the Trax. They used to have one in the US called the Tracker, which was a captive import version of the Suzuki Sidekick (called the Vitara everywhere else) And the Trax is called the Tracker in Russia/CIS states... Because the name Trax, if you read the letters that look similar to Cyrillic as Cyrillic, and the r as an r, it becomes a rude word for ""fornicate."" And it's not just cars, either. Clairol used to make a humidifier called the Mist Machine. It didn't sell very well in German speaking countries, because who wants a manure machine in their home?

Volkswagen is the king of multiple names. In the 70s, they released the Golf. A practical, reliable, inexpensive family hatchback, named after the gulfstream, which brings warm air from the gulf of Mexico to Europe, and is the reason places like Germany and France, which are as far north as Canada, aren't frozen tundra. But in the North America, they called it the Rabbit. Later, it became there Golf here as well. And then the Rabbit again. And back to Golf. The Golf's sedan sibling was called the Jetta for its first 2 generations over in Europe. Then it became the Vento. Then the Bora. And back to Jetta. In North America? It was always the Jetta.

Honestly, Volkswagen is kind of dumb for this. Their name changes had nothing to do with translation issues, they were always kind of silly. The cars that truly sell well universally are the ones where they found a good, universal name right away, and stuck with it. Everyone in the world knows what a Toyota Corolla is. Toyota has called their small to medium small family sedan the Corolla for almost 50 years. Same with the Honda Civic.

"Toyota is going to be your brand for reliability. Newer Corollas can usually be found around the price point, but Camrys will run higher. Great MPG, great city vehicles. 
Most new cars will be plenty safe, but Volvo and Subaru are two brands known for their higher safety standards. Subaru legacies can be found relatively new around that price point (and are standard AWD). Newer volvos, you are going to have trouble finding around there.

Onstar or something similar is something to consider if you are concerned for safety, as well as lane assist and assisted braking. Many new cars come standard with the assisted braking, but I would double check.

I would say that a Corolla is a great, economical first car. Based on wanting safety, the Subaru legacy is a great option too. One thing you might consider is throwing the car insurance under your name, and just have him pay you monthly. Helps to keep costs low.",0.012783578,0.117407046,0.8698094

If the spark plugs haven't been changed, you should change them, and depending on the year of the truck, they are recommended to be changed every 60k or 100k. Now the tough question! The transmission! If you have the service history, see if the fluid has been changed. If it has been changed, that's great! It needs to be serviced every 60k! I don't care that toyota says it's lifetime fill. A lot of manufacturers are switching to saying life time fill and well the life time is of the warranty.... there's a Toyota Master Diagnostion on YouTube (Car care nut), and he has seen it all for over 20 years, and he says the same thing. Now, here's the flip side. If it has not been changed or you don't have the service records for it at 125k, you are in a harry situation. At that point, I would take it to a dealership. Yes, I know it will be expensive, but hear me out. I would take it to them and ask if they feel safe servicing the fluid. If they say yes, then you may let them. And here is why I recommend the dealership. At 125k, it should have had the transmission serviced twice. And if it has never had a service, there comes a chance that your transmission may fail after service, and by asking the dealership if it is safe, they now become liable for replacing your transmission. But if they say no. At that point, NEVER service it just always make sure it is full. You should still make it to 200k maybe even higher with no issues. And at that point, depending on if you want to keep the truck forever, I would start saving a fund for a way into the future transmission swap.

Whatever y‚Äôall got for me is SO appreciated.  We are trying to decide between a 2019 Toyota Corolla SE (2wd) with 22k miles for 21,998. It was a personal vehicle with a clean carfax. Other option is a 2020 Toyota Corolla LE with 32k miles for the same price. That one was a lease and has a clean carfax. With tax/tag/title/registration we are looking at about another two grand. We are in MD so the CarMax 199 dealer fee is much better than the 599 most dealers in MD charge. We will be financing through our bank who works directly with CarMax.

Which car is the better long term choice? The 2019 seems to have more issues from what my brief uneducated internet research has said. I prefer the interior of the 2019 much more but I know that 2020 has a few more features and a better engine. I drive a little to work so MPG and engine capability matter. I drive on highways and interstates. But what matters most to me is reliability and safety. We are stuck on the mile difference but maybe the 2020 is better since I haven‚Äôt seen as many known problems with that year.

Please help us we just can‚Äôt seem to figure this out, haha! And no we absolutely cannot afford a brand new Corolla we‚Äôve looked at it and sadly can‚Äôt do it.

"I said nothing about ""prohibiting"" Frankenbites, nor have I ever said they should invariably should lead to defamation claims. You just asked how filmmakers could avoid jury trials and I said Frankenbites should put them on notice of risk.

&gt;So like an article summarizing Colborn's cross might say ""The defense played a tape of Colborn calling in the victim's plate numbers and suggested Colborn had secretly discovered the vehicle."" 

&gt;A summery of MaM's coverage of Colborn's cross can also very easily read the exact same as the quote in the above paragraph.

Not the same thing at all. When a reader reads such a written summary, they know it is somebody's interpretation of what they saw and heard. It does not purport to be a verbatim account. Although viewers of MaM know they are not seeing all of the trial or necessarily all of Colborn's testimony, they are lead to believe, and do believe, that what they are seeing and hearing accurately reflects what happened, at least for the moments that are shown. In the filmmakers' words, the perspective of the movie is supposedly that of a ""fly on the wall."" Except this fly lives in an alternate universe. 

Because of this difference, the viewer also reasonably thinks he is learning far more information that what is or could be conveyed by your newspaper summary. The viewer *thinks* he is seeing potentially telling pauses, gestures, expressions and similar information that we rely on as much or more than words -- except in many instances *these* are Frankenbites as well. 

The edits also change the apparent significance of what is said by Colborn, by having it appear to come from ""the horse's mouth."" One example: right before Strang asks Colborn the question in which the filmmakers insert their Frankenbite ""yes,"" Colborn says the only way he could have known the car information is if he got it from Wiegert. Challenging this answer, Strang asks,

&gt;""Well, you can understand how someone listening to that might think that you were calling in the license plate that you were look at on the back of a 1999 Toyota."" 

When Colborn apparently says ""yes,"" the ""telling"" implication is that everything he says could have been learned by looking at the car.  Except it is very unlikely that is true. Colborn is never asked if he can tell a 1999 Toyota from a 1998 Toyota, and he probably cannot. The viewer may not think about all of this, but the clear implication of his fake ""yes"" answer is that everything in the call could have been known just by looking. By contrast, the question that Colborn *actually* answered is far more general -- whether the call

&gt;sounded like hundreds of other license plate or registration checks you have done""

Not the same implication that all of the information in the call could have been learned by looking at a license plate -- which is what Strang was trying to show when he challenged Colborn's answer that he had to get information from Wiegert. Who knows, Colborn might have said this, if the question had not been ""answered"" by the filmmakers for him. I have no doubt the other edits -- such as deleting ""see if it comes back to"" and the casual banter from the recording, were also intended to convey greater potential culpability to viewers. 

&gt;Like it or not, the courts apply the same understanding of video journalism. 

If they do, they shouldn't. My entire point is that such an analysis is childishly naive, and in no manner dictated by reason or even Supreme Court authority. And Frankenbites  and doctored video isn't ""journalism."" They are the offspring of reality tv at its worst.

EDIT:  Ironically, the unreasonable deference given to video misrepresentation may ultimately backfire, as people become more educated and more and more distrustful of what they see on tv.

Hydrogen has serious storage and shipping problems.  Not much worse, though, than vehicles that run on LPG/CNG - similar risks, although hydrogen tank storage pressures are much higher.

Our country would have to build a complete new infrastructure for hydrogen powered vehicles.

EV's on the other hand, can take advantage of the existing grid, and it can be incrementally improved --- like running 4AWG wire to your garage for a charger.  Adding solar panels to charge it during daylight hours.  Eventually, YES, a better,  larger grid would need capacity improvements if EVERYONE drove an EV.  But that's decades away, plenty of time to work on it. 

There is still, and will for a long time, be a glut of electric power at night available to charge EV's.  Cheaply or not-so-cheaply, depending on the greed of your local utility. 

Meanwhile the ""round trip"" of converting some fuel - coal, natural gas, even nuclear or solar energy - to hydrogen is less efficient than the ""round trip"" of charging and discharging a battery.  

Very little hydrogen is produced by electrolyzing water, a very inefficient method of creating it.  **Most hydrogen is created by ""reforming"" natural gas, a fossil fuel**.  A % of the natural gas is consumed as energy to energize the reformation reaction. 

Only when there are large amounts of excess renewable power --- wind, solar - used to electrolyze water, however inefficiently --- will hydrogen become ""clean.""   **Any hydrogen you purchase and use today is just as dirty as if you had burned the natural gas used to create it.** 

Very bluntly stated, an ultra-clean hydrogen economy, hydrogen-powered fuels are a pipe dream, an unobtainable utopia compared to the very real, WIDELY available today EV's and hybrid vehicles.

Yes I am well aware Toyota is pumping millions (billions) into a demonstrator project, with actual hydrogen vehicles roaming the streets of Southern California.",0.58549875,0.3818299,0.03267139

"This is actually a very interesting discussion, because it's a bit of Japanese car history that people don't know too much about.

They were as much Tourers as BMW sedans are coupes. The badge may say that, doesn't mean they are. The Soarer was, but the Soarer has always been a much nicer car, and the cheapest Soarer was at the same price as the most expensive JZX car - the most expensive Soarer cost as much as 2 JZXs. Camry and Mark II/Chaser pricing on the other hand were nearly identical for 1999 with the Camry actually being slightly more expensive trim for trim, though the Camry lacked the super high trims that the JZXs had.

D-Segement cars in general are rarely economy family cars outside of North America and Aus/NZ, since they become a large car segement in places where car size impacts running cost by a lot. 

The offical replacement for the Cressida/Mark II in the States was the Avalon, which was mainly a North America-only special that didn't work anywhere else: Toyota filled that spot in other markets with higher trimmed Camrys under various names - the Vienta and the Aurion in Australia, which ended up making up the basis for Camrys sold in Asia as a more premium vehicle. 

The ""big economy car in North America = premium in Japan"" isn't limited to Toyota, in fact every large Japanese car maker has done it to an extent, although Mazda may be the exception with the Capella/626. The USDM Maxima and Accord were sold as the premium Cefiro and Inspire, while the Legacy and Galant did the same thing as the Camry (the Diamante being one class up, but Mitsubishi has always struggled with more premium cars in general and pulled out of that early.) This isn't limited to Japan either, sometimes laughable - like when the 4th gen Camry was sold as a 5-Series competitior in Germany, with predictable results.

The reason why Nissan and Toyota could have FWD and RWD options in the same segment was due to their large separated dealer networks with different lineups per network, and having a near-monopoly on the Japanese car market, so having several cars in the same class to suck in all the buyers was perfectly fine. This tactic no longer works due to the rise of imports and SUVs/vans plus a general decline in car buying, and the JDM D-segment is nearly dead as a result.",0.028930737,0.45804638,0.51302284

"Fintel.io isn't a great site, I've posted inaccurate information from it before which another user corrected with [more thorough and up-to-date information](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/vcvc). ""Institutional ownership"" refers to financial institutions and it won't list, for example, [AAM's holdings in Ree](https://www.aam.com/docs/default-source/annual-reports/axl-annual-report-2021.pdf). On the other hand, we can see that Morgan Stanley doubled their stake in Ree in February.

Specifically for Magna International, they're mentioned in one list as ""Hino Motors, Magna International, JB Poindexter, EAVX and Morgan Olson"" with other upper chassis / ""top hat"" partners. Hino conceptualized the Flatformer, JBP-MO-EAVX manufactures the Proxima. That would imply, although it's a bit of a stretch, that Magna is supplying the top hat for the P7B.

Some business partners that have announced they're invested in Ree:

* American Axle - drive unit supplier
* KYB - suspension supplier
* Magna - upper chassis / ""top hat"" supplier**?** For the P7B**?**
* Mahindra - manufacturing capacity supplier
* Mitsubishi - fleet financing partner
* Musashi - manufacturing capacity supplier
* Tenneco - component supplier
* Toyota - Flatformer concept developer

If Ree's deals with its partners are more or less the same as its [deal with Mahindra](https://ree.auto/press-release/5768/), it has secured a supply scale-up potential up to 250,000 vehicles. Before the merger, the plan was to achieve this by the end of 2024. After the merger, the funding shortfall of about $200M delayed immediate expansion plans. The evaporation of autonomous vehicle prospects with Navya freed up any planned AV manufacturing capacity. I expect there are no capacity or supply chain shortages, since the initial deals gave Ree plenty of headroom. I expect these investors would want Ree to succeed so Ree uses their services for the expected 250,000 vehicles.

"I'd recommend getting a compressor as one of the first things to buy, you need to let your tyres down almost everytime you go offroad.

Regarding the other things on your list, here's how I did them;

Tyres - mine had 265/75-16s when I bought it.

Driving lights - also fitted when I bought.

Bullbar

Winch - haven't use it a lot but gave us a lot more confidence as we go out by ourselves to some pretty remote places. Maxtrax for the same reason.

Diff breathers

2 inch lift - you don't generally need a diff drop with a 2 inch lift, you might need castor corrected upper control arms though. I haven't bothered with a GVM.

Battery system

Snorkel

Regarding the other stuff;

Catch can - I have a petrol.

Roof rack - don't have one and I am trying to do everything I can not to fit one. It mightn't fit in my garage and it will reduce fuel economy (petrol)

Tray and canopy - don't intend (at this stage) to convert from a tub/canopy mainly due to the age of my vehicle and overall cost + I'm not convinced it will suit us the best.

UHF - only have a couple of handhelds. They've served us well so far. I removed the belt clip and glued on a metal phone mount plate so they stick to the magnetic phone mounts on the dash.

Recovery points - Haven't bothered bc I drive a Toyota. I can't comment on other vehicles but my standard ones are pretty beefy. The whole 'rated recovery' point thing is one of the greatest myths in the 4wd community with ppl calling the factory ones 'tie down points' which is total BS. If you check your manual they'll be called 'tow points'. They're mainly designed for towing though not yanking on them like idiots. The bolt on ones are also not indistructo-points, they come with no test information to confirm the 'rating' and you can actually do more damage to the chassis with them fitted as there is no real testing with them. Perhaps other cars have really crappy ones?? YMMV

Bash plates - Still yet to fit. Only dinged the factory ones once which were easy to straighten. The idea is not to 'bash' the underside of your vehicle, even with ""bash plates"" there's still a lot of things to hit under there! If the factory ones end up copping a beating, I'll consider it then, otherwise it's extra weight.

Finally I'll say, work out the weight of all the shit you're carrying. You'll be surprised how quickly you end up over-weight even in a dual cab. I dunno how ppl in wagons do it?",0.19896285,0.6330508,0.16798636

"Hi.

First off, speaking from 18 years of experience in car sales, management, and working in the finance office, your TransUnion score doesn't mean diddly. The gold standard for banks lending money for auto loans is Equifax. Equifax. EQUIFAX!!

You can get your Equifax score for free using the Borrowwell app. 

IF your EQUIFAX score is above say, 650-680, and you have no collections, no judgements and no late payments of 30 days or more on your open accounts, you're LIKELY to be approved if you can verify your income.

Regarding interest rate..

Is this a brand new truck? Or used?

When I go to Toyota.ca and use the ""Build and Price"" tool on a $57k Tundra Crew Max SR I get(from the website)

Total Amount to Finance: $64493.85(including HST, fees, etc.)

Finance 72m = $503.87/BW
$0 Down
6.79% Finance Interest Rate

Now, you might notice that 6.79% is quite low here in 2023. This is because it's a BRAND NEW vehicle. It's a ""Sub-Vented"" rate. Toyota Canada has made a deal with 2 or 3 partner lenders. The deal is, Toyota BUYS DOWN the regular rate, which would be like 9%, and offers YOU the truck at 6.79%. Don't worry, the bank is getting paid!

You're still sort of paying that interest, though, because it just gets jammed into the cost that Toyota sells the truck to the dealer for, and then reflected in the MSRP. 


Now this is where a dealership can really fuck your life up. The Finance Manager at the dealership can TELL YOU, that your credit isn't good enough for the 6.79%, but great news! We got your approval at 9.99%!! Woo hoo!

Here's why this isn't great news. Here in 2023, 8-9% is considered a PRIME RATE for an auto loan, when it USED to be like 5.99% back in 2019-2021. IF they tell you that you qualify at 9%, then that's considered good credit. You SHOULD qualify at 6.79% then, because that is the adjusted Prime Rate for a new car.

They'd only tell you 9% because...the dealership gets a commission, based on the amount financed, for NOT using the 6.79%. In this case the commission, called a ""Reserve"" in dealer speak, would be close to $3k, maybe more. I can't do the math in my head.

If they Finance you at 6.79%, then the dealer gets no, or VERY LITTLE($500ish...maybe?) Commission. Depends on the deal Toyota has with the partner lenders. 

My advice is, DO NOT apply for the pre-approval if your Equifax. EQUIFAX...looks good. When you apply for a pre-approval, a sharp Finance manager who gets that lead is going to automatically assume you have concerns about your credit...he/she will see your Equifax, but will assume YOU think you have dicey credit and are thus, somewhat ignorant of what you might qualify for. If they're shady, they'll use this grey area to try and convince you that you don't qualify for 6.79%(or whatever the non-commissioned  rate is) but instead are FORCED to take the higher rate.üôÑüòè

Does all that make sense? 

Just to CLARIFY: The 6.79% rate I quoted is

1. A Subvented rate to finance a BRAND NEW Toyota Tundra

2. I got this number from the Toyota.ca website, using the ""Build and Price"" tool. I have not visited a Toyota dealership. I do not work at a Toyota dealership.

***warning info dump***

I'm in the market for some old but not too old toyota tacomas and found some at an auto dealer that are ~1k less than what the markets in the city are charging for the base models with similar or worse mileage.

City dealer wants 10k for a 2008 Toyota tacoma with 219k miles (good price in this market?)

Country dealer wants 10,500 for a 2007 tacoma with 164k miles OR 8,500 for a 2010 tacoma with 176k miles (all trucks mentioned are base models btw).

The city dealers truck seems pretty standard especially since its an offshoot of the nohaggle business model. Its got 1 owners waay out of state with no accidents and a pretty clean history. Very boring carfax. The other dealers trucks both are coming from a state over and the cheaper one has had 4 owners while the more expensive one has only had two. Both have accidents with minor damage. Something else EXTREMELY concerning is that these vehicles have NO HISTORY for 2 years after being sold to auction in 2021. Is that worrying to anybody?

I just can't wrap my head around their pricing though. They KNOW they could get more from it, so why aren't they? Is there something I'm not seeing that could pertain to how they drive? (I haven't been to the country dealership to check them out but have been given promises of smooth rides).

When I scan through more inventory from the country dealer I'm getting similarly low prices on cars. All about 1,000+ less than what you'd expect from the same or worse vehicles. Did I finally encounter a dealer who hasnt gone mad with the market, or is he looking to make his money back through fees and other add-ons? The market is just so damn crazy for these hinky donk light trucks that it seems too good to be true. 

What do you gentlemen and ladies think? And should I stop wasting my time and buy something better for the same amount of cash?

With BEVs It's getting easier with the day, literally, as fast charger stations are installed every day.  I drive from Belgium to Spain with 0 issues with my eNiro, for half the price as diesel/gasoline. New BEVa are getting close to 600km range and 300kW charging speeds. Meanwhile h2 fueling stations are indeed being installed,  but far far less. The distance between h2 stations is greater than the difference in range between a model 3 and a Toyota miara for example. You make a point for phfcev, and I used to see the use cases, but with the direction and evolution in EVs and the rollout of charging - at least in EU - the need to range extentions is becoming obsolete.

I would also personally reccomend changing out the ""brake hardware"", which is just some little clips that let the pad slide in and out so it's not sticking to the rotor.

This is all assuming OEM pads, which in my opinion as a random dude on the internet, is worth the price given how long they last, especially on the prius.

Oh and also having everything cleaned with a can of brake cleaner (be sure to keep it away from the rubber hoses though, it'll eat em right up). And also having the rotor itself checked, and if needed, resurfaced/replaced, especially if it's a bit crusty-looking.

"Green Hydrogen is already cost competitive compared to petroleum fuel in India, Petrol costs more than 100‚Çπ/L and the average fuel economy of petrol cars is 14-20km/L which means that it costs 7.14-5‚Çπ/km, now let's compare it to green Hydrogen, green Hydrogen manufacturing costs is 300-330‚Çπ/kg, it should be available to consumers for approximately 500‚Çπ/kg and a Fuel cell car like Toyota Mirai can hold at least 5.6kg of Hydrogen and it can run for 640km before needing a refill which means that fuel cell vehicles cost 4.37‚Çπ/km (500‚Çπ x 5.6kg / 640km). Fuel cell vehicles don't suffer from any kind of performance degradation in cold weather. Indian government has announced National Hydrogen Mission and Indian companies like Reliance, GAIL, L&amp;T, Adani Enterprise etc are making big investments to bring green Hydrogen manufacturing cost down to less than 100‚Çπ/kg which means that in near future fuel cell vehicles will become even more cost-competitive compared to petroleum vehicles. However the cost of Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles is still high compared to petroleum vehicles, price of fuel cell vehicles will reduce when production will increase. Companies like Toyota, BMW, Hyundai have a very important role in green mobility solutions because these companies are leader in fuel cell technologies, they should work with the Indian government and try to establish hydrogen infrastructure as soon as possible, Automobile companies should launch highly affordable fuel cell cars to compete with battery electric vehicles, a fuel cell version of existing cars at a competitive price can make fuel-cell cars popular very soon. Batteries are big, bulky, and heavy, to carry a lot of weight for a long distance we need to add lots of batteries, and the more batteries we add the charging time increase and the more weight we add and to carry that extra weight we need to add even more batteries which are not practical especially in large commercial vehicles like trucks, trains, ships etc, This is the reason that Indian Railways is converting its diesel locomotives into Hydrogen Fuel Cell locomotives. Battery components are available in some countries like China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Australia, etc, we need to import components like Lithium and Cobalt from those countries. Currently, we are dependent on OPEC for fulfilling our energy needs, if every vehicle will be replaced by battery electric vehicles then we will have to be dependent on countries like China, Australia and the Democratic Republic of Congo for getting materials used in batteries. Batteries are also expensive and difficult to recycle and have a shorter life span compared to fuel cells. Switching to Hydrogen can make most countries like India self-sufficient in their energy needs. Excess electricity can be stored in big Hydrogen tanks and be used as needed. Microsoft successfully tested Hydrogen Fuel cell generators to power its data centre, they also use batteries for instant response to power failure but batteries can only provide power for a few hours, Hydrogen is lighter and more energy-dense compared to any battery, also the refueling time is very short compared to batteries. Big vehicles like large commercial trucks will need very high-power superchargers to charge the truck in a short time. It can take down the electricity grid even if there are less than half a dozen large trucks charging simultaneously because it will require a large amount of power from the electricity grid which can fail and shut down any kind of power grid. Also, fast charging degrades batteries faster compared to slow charging. shipping industry also wants to move to Hydrogen Fuel Cell based zero emissions technology to power small and large marine vessels because you can't run marine vessels from batteries only. Some people are hating Hydrogen Fuel Cell vehicles because Elon Musk has always criticised and made fun of fuel cell technology. Musk is intelligent but he can not be right all the time. Batteries should be used in electronic devices(SmartPhones, Laptops, etc), for vehicles Hydrogen Fuel Cell technology makes more sense. government must accelerate the switch to green mobility solutions by rapidly creating and improving the Hydrogen Infrastructure(Hydrogen Gas Stations), setting up a Hydrogen fuel station is expensive because it is new and upcoming technology but if government can open a new public sector enterprise which setup Hydrogen fuel stations in India then consumers will get more confidence and they will start buying Hydrogen fuel cell automobiles which can significantly reduce pollution, also because of high cost of setting up the Hydrogen fuel station private petrol pump owners are reluctant to open Hydrogen fuel stations, government can setup a new company with public, private, partnership model which will produce Hydrogen and distribute it via Hydrogen fuel stations.",0.16172391,0.7126476,0.1256284

Looking to be approved for new truck with low credit

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm looking to be approved for a new truck ($57k truck) with $0 down. My trans union score is 680, mainly because my credit cards are so low in credit limit (never increased) so my utilization is high by default. 

My history is just 2 credit cards, and a student loan ($24k). I pay everything on time, and I make $130k per year in salary. 

I‚Äôm submitting for pre approval to Toyota dealership soon, what are my chances of being approved? Any info would help! Thank you in advance.

"Infinite growth really means infinite expansion. Let me explain it like this:

Toyota starts selling cars in Texas, over a few years they do well and decide to expand production of cars to better meet demand, so immediately more raw material must be mined and treated for use. They then decide to expand to neighboring states in order to increase profits, immediately again even more resources must be mined and treated to better meet their new demand with a new customer base. Rinse and repeat this process for years and there's your ""infinite growth."" companies only get more profitable when they expand their customer base or raise prices, and in order to stay competitive they usually opt to expand their customer base, aka grow.

The world has only been truly capitalist in the last 200 years so thankfully we still have a lot of resources left, but in the future if this infinite growth continues, resources are bound to get scarce which means prices are bound to get much higher, living will become more unaffordable, and conflicts will be fought over the remaining resources.

"&gt;For how many years and for how many miles would it survive?

Depends a lot on your usage, however battery lifespan is largely determined by cycles, which is how much the battery is used **relative to the size of the battery**.

The Fusion Hybrid has an unusually large battery for a hybrid at about 87% larger than the battery in the 4th gen Prius. That means that the Fusion Hybrid's battery needs to be used 87% more than a Prius battery to reach the same number of cycles.

The Prius's battery is warrantied to 10 years/150k miles. In many areas Toyota is actually going way above and beyond the legally mandated minimum battery warranty, so that's a strong indication that they don't expect it to cost them a ton in replacements. Most anecdotal reports I've seen indicate that even in use cases that are especially hard on the battery (ex. NYC taxi driving is a common usage of the Prius) it rarely needs replacement before 250k miles.

Since the Fusion Hybrid's battery is significantly larger than a Prius's battery, I expect the Fusion Hybrid's battery to last even longer.",0.03616932,0.8288759,0.13495478

"They sold the CH-R hybrid in some places. It still actually exists right along side the much newer and much better Yaris Cross Hybrid for some reason, but hey, #justtoyotathings .

Also on Toyota's scale, you seeing 1 Prius C a day does not a market make. In the US, the Prius C sold between 35k and 40k per year between 2012 and 2015. 2016 was 20k, and a precipitous drop from there. Sure, some of it can be credited to it being essentially the same car in 2018 as it was in 2012, save for some new headlights. Meanwhile, between 2012 and 2015 the Gen 3 Prius did between 185k and 236k per year. And 2016, despite being all-new only managed 136k (down from 185k in 2015), and if you want to say the original Gen 4 was 3edgy5you, the refresh did nothing -- 69k (nice) for 2019, 43k for 2020. 

I guess there are 2 points to be made out of the data. 

1. Apples to apples, year by year, the regular Prius outsold the C by an order of magnitude. So no surprise that Toyota did not bring the current gen Aqua over as a new-gen Prius C to the US. 

2. Looks like the days of Prius being the volume model are done. And this agrees with what you're saying that it should be the Buick of Toyota basically. And that's basically what they are trying to do with the Gen 5 -- you want a compact sedan/hatch hybrid - they'll sell you a Corolla. You want a nicer version - you have the Prius. In your logic - the Venza should be rebranded as the Prius Venza since it's the nicer version of a Rav4 hybrid.",0.038541913,0.6134732,0.34798482

"Use this for basic pricing checks: https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/  

Looks like a 2013 Camry goes for an average of $13152. The market for cars like the Camry is very efficient, don't overthink it, $10.5K is reasonable for dealer price. Torn seats are a good thing actually because it's an easy fix and people avoid buying cars with a torn seat, you can get a replacement car seat in nice condition at a junkyard for ~$250. Check car-part.com for stuff like that.

All that said, 125K miles is quite a lot, even though you'll probably be ok since it's a Toyota. You can get other reliable cars with HALF the miles for the same money. For example, you can get 2016 Scion iA or a 2014/15 Mazda5 with 65K miles for the same price of $11-13K. The Scion is basically a Toyota Corolla but because the brand was discontinued, it's an afterthought in the used market and thus cheaper. The Mazda5 is also a solid option because it's actually spacious and seats 6 and rents well on Turo.

Finally, I advise against a loan to do this with the budget car strategy. The used economy car strategy is a cash car strategy. If your car breaks down or something happens, you're toast with the loan. If you have no other option than a loan for an $11K car, then get the loan but drive Uber when the car isn't being rented out so you can own the car outright as soon as possible. It's very risky to finance your first and only car on Turo. Have one or two cash cars first and then if you like Turo and want to grow you can finance a nicer 3rd car that you can then pay for easily with the earnings from your other car(s) if a car goes down.",0.039881248,0.5174259,0.4426929

"Last comment I'll make on this post before it's retired. First, I will say that I'm humbled and frankly surprised by the comments that were shared... There were the expected mouth breathers whom confuse their identify of self with the firearm platform they have adopted... this happens with all brands and with all activities where there is an engaged enthusiast base. 

I appreciate the feedback and have come away with new ideas of how I can better my experience next time... sounds like 124 gr carry ammunition is a good idea. 

Again, I will say that I believe Shadow Systems has a lot to offer the firearms market and community. I think that the quality, value and feature-set are head and shoulders above anything else in the market... Especially when looking at the Glock platform. The hand feel and natural point of aim is 

I had a couple members accuse me of being a Glock fan. I will say that I have as much brand loyalty to Glock as I do to the hammers and screwdrivers in my toolbox... I couldn't tell you what brand they are but I do know they work every time I use them. 

I view firearms simply as tools. I am an enthusiast but am not a collector... If I was a collector I would hands down have kept the MR and CR920... and probably would have added to them with an XR or DR... But I'm not a collector. Everything in my system has a very specific purpose.

The first gun that I purchased myself was a Glock 19 Gen 3 that I got in the early Y2K's when I was in my early 20s. This set me down a path of seeking commonality. I have dozens of Glock mags that are comparable with all of my Glock pistols. At this time, switching to a new platform simply isn't advantageous. My main reason for investing in Shadow Systems was to have a more premium experience while maintaining system commonality... If the system was a reliable as my Glocks I wouldn't have hesitated to go all in... and perhaps I will some day.  

I currently have 3 cartridges for for platforms: 9mm Pistol, 5.56 AR-15 and 12 Gauge Shotgun. I value reliability in my tools over everything else. I am not concerned with premium status... I am concerned that my tools work every time I need them to. I currently run Glock, BCM and Mossberg... this is the exact same reason I only drive Toyota 4Runners... sure there are other options that are more premium but for my money these are the most reliable and functional tools in my system. 

If I was a collector and only used my firearms on the range... I'd be all in with Shadow Systems. The reality is, I'm not and I need every tool in my system to be 100% reliable 100% of the time. At this time, with my experience I just can't have that 100% trust in the SS platform. I am confident that SS is a great brand and will continue to progress... when they do, I'll come back.",0.13131866,0.5790719,0.28960952

"Still early days with the CX5 for me but Some things that I feel like I have gotten used to on my CRV.
1. The MPG auto resets each time the tank is filled up. Not on CX5. Helps me know the mileage for each tank fill. I know i can manual reset that each time the tank is filled on the CX5 but I am just used to the CRV way. 
2. Touch screen vs rotary dial on the CX5. Though, I feel like I can get used to that eventually. I also feel like the infotainment needs to many touches to go inside menus - it's too simplified. 
3. Digital cluster on the CRV vs analog one on the CX5 Preferred trim. I could have (should have) gotten the premium trim for that feature but seems like such an obvious miss in 2023. I got the EX on the CRV, so not the top most model. 
4. Space - CRV is super spacious, for being a similar sized vehicle as the CX5. The cargo room is amazing and even the second row has more space. WE really did not need two cars with similar spaces so no real world gripe there but just factual that CX5 has much less space.
5. I do feel that the Lane Assist on Honda is more matured. It keeps me centered in the lane, even on curved roads. This is something I found little lacking on the CX5. Still early days though. 
6. The cup holders are at a weird place in the centre console - again , a lot of that is due to the space is occupied by the rotary dial for the display screen. But, I feel like I will eventually get used to it. 
7. The center arm rest for the driver seat can move forward so you can rest your right hand better. Something that's missing on the CX5. 
8. In terms of the engine power and going up and down on hilly inclines, I feel both are at par. I don't rev the engines like a young person anymore (getting old), so can't compare that. 
9. I was also hoping that Android Auto was wireless on this car like so many others in 2023 but alas. 

CX5 does excel in looks vs the CRV hands down and the fact that it has some more features that aren't on my CRV. The steering is more responsive and the drive is more fun hands down. The interior is also more plush looking vs the CRV but the CRV isn't as bad as let's say a Toyota RAV4. 
We had been admiring CX5 on the roads for a while now (plus really liked my Mazda 6 all thes years back) so happy to have gotten one now. No complaints as of now but I think I can make an impartial comparison between the two as I drive both regularly.

The CR-V handles better, and has a better mechanical AWD system, so it will handle bad conditions like snow better. I also think the CR-V looks better.


That being said, MPG is worse in the CR-V. Toyota's engines are simply better, both their dynamic force engines and their hybrids compared to Honda, producing more power while being more efficient. I wish I can buy a CR-V with the Toyota 2.5L dynamic force engine.


I think I would have chosen a CR-V anyway even if Toyota wasn't having production capacity and markup issues. I like my ride nice and quiet.


Between the CR-V hybrids and gas, it comes down to what you value. MPG? Go hybrid.

"I'm usually not ""brand loyal"" but Toyota's got me hooked. When my parents got a new car they gave me their '02 Camry for free (This was years before Covid, so she probably wasn't worth much at the time. Still not a good excuse for what I did) so I could drive myself to school when I eventually got my license, but due to some personal stuff happening in my life I neglected her for years.

When I was 19 I got a job in the next town over and my parents didn't want me driving their car, so my dad and I went to my car, thinking that it was going to be a difficult or expensive repair. But this Toyota really surprised us! All we did was pop the hood and replace the battery (which was corroded and leaking) and she was singing like nothing happened.

Toyota technically says that their transmissions do not need service. It says it on the trans dipstick if you read it. I personally drain and fill mine every 30k miles. A drain and fill is more like a fluid refresh which is why I do it more often. It is safer then doing a whole flush like you‚Äôll get at a dealership.

"Lightness does not by itself make a car less safe, it's mostly about making parts out of aluminum, tubes instead of solid shafts, etc. Lightness also makes it easier to brake the car and thus prevents crashes in the first place. Most cars are quite safe these days, and since you're buying a bigger car, they are safer than a compact car. Double check the crash test ratings before you buy one if it gives you peace of mind.

The 100K powertrain warranty is total odometer mileage I believe. If you don't buy a CPO and get a regular used Kia/Hyundai, then it's the usual 60K miles warranty. Lots of CPO programs offer very good warranties nowadays, I think Chevy's CPO is also 100k, so shop around, they are generally worth it.

Koreans depreciate a bit more than Mazda and yes it's mostly public perception. They are not quite as bulletproof as Toyota, so you could get some minor issues, but you are very unlikely to have costly engine/transmission problems. The extra cost for a Toyota/Honda isn't worth it for most used cars, I would only buy them new.

Both new and used minivans are very hard to get for a reasonable price right now. The Chrysler Pacifica and the dated old Caravans are more affordable but probably not worth it because they have serious reliability issues. The single best used option is probably the 2018-2021 Kia Sedona for about 23.5K, it's sweet, reliable and priced well. The only problem is that you want to call your insurance company beforehand to know if they will insure it and for how much. And you will have to use a wheel lock when you park on the street.... State Farm stopped insuring a bunch of the Kias because they are easy to steal and were getting stolen in big numbers. There is a software fix coming but it's not available for all the cars affected yet. The new Kia Carnival is a great and attractively priced and not subject to thefts, but supply is tight still and I would wait until you can get one for MSRP (or below). The Honda Odyssey isn't hybrid nor cheap so not really worth it, although some low mile 2019 ones for 26K would be a good enough deal. You could also finance a new Sienna (use a credit union for lower rates) which is an excellent hybrid, but it's also hard to get and going over MSRP. If you wanted to buy a family car to hold for 15-20 years, a new Sienna would be the one.",0.1389009,0.645356,0.21574312

I don‚Äôt get everybody who says they dislike it because of comedy talk, I get it if it‚Äôs not your thing, I personally like hearing it, but that‚Äôs only literally 20-30 minutes of the two hour 50 minute episode, I still have 50 minutes to go so I can‚Äôt say that 1000% but it‚Äôs a fairly minimal part of the episode, they spent equal or more time talking about yeonmis heavies or about cobalt in cell phones and humanity issues then they did talking about Joe‚Äôs standup business in Austin.

"When a General Motors store floors with GMFinancial or Toyota store floors with Toyota Financial it‚Äôs called ‚Äúflooring with your captive‚Äù

When a dealer is approved to take over a store as a new dealer generally flooring with the captive is a requirement if your going to require assistance ‚Äúminority or female program etc‚Äù where the manufacturer finances 85% of the franchise for you for 3 to 5 years.  They require you to use the captive, the DMS they want, the pay plans they want etc etc. 

Once paid off many stick with them because floorplans from banks each come with their own set of rewards programs and CAP account benefits.

‚ÄúSend me 40 deals a month and we will send you an extra 1000 per car in addition to the reserve‚Äù
As a simple example.

A CAP account is essentially a deal between the dealer and the floor plan bank where you can X% of your floor plan value in an account with that bank in cash and they will pay you the rate they are charging the store on that cash. (Typically held in an offshore, growing until you want to use to buy another store ü§ì)

So for example we can have 75% of floor plan so we have 11million in a cap acct and make 40 to 50 a month in an offshore.

We do not floor with the captive, we make more money elsewhere because of the 75% deal on captive and we hit our banks rewards program",0.043335833,0.8902631,0.06640108

Ale ja nie mowilem o swoich pogladach. LUDZIE wybrali, wiec eurovany odeszly w niepamiec a masz teraz Suvy. Jakby sie sprzedawaly to by nikt ich nie przestawal oferowac.

Jaki to ma w og√≥le zwiƒÖzek z mustangiem?! Ten Mustang to te≈º jest mem ale traktuje siƒô go powa≈ºnie. Po za tym hummera nie bƒôdzie ale ranger, bronco, explorer sƒÖ dostƒôpne na rynku europejskim. Jest to co najmniej przera≈ºajƒÖce.

Zrobili ze sportowego coupe elektrycznego suva bo tylko tak sie dalo go zelektryfikowac. Ta baterie gdzies trzeba wcisnac, wiec podloga tak czy siak by spuchla. To zreszta jest ogolny trend - duzo latwiej wlozyc 600kg baterii w auto ktore jest wyzsze i zachowac znosna bryle.

Ogolnie caly watek jest dosyc zabawny bo importujesz problemy z USA, ktore w europie nie istnieja. Taki trend widocznie ostatnio, nawet klekanie importowalismy.Top 5 najlepiej sie sprzedajacy modeli 2022 w Europie:

1. Peugot 208 - mniejszy niz yaris nawet
2. Dacia Sandero - j/w
3. Volkswagen T-Roc - o ile pamietam to jest golf ""cross"", do duzych nie nalezy zdecydowanie.
4. Fiat 500 -male
5. VW golf - srednie.Na calej liscie top50 ciezko znalesc cos duzego, wlascwie tylko RAV i Karoq.

A jak taka lista wyglada dla usa?

1. Ford F  - ogromny pickup
2. Chevy Silverado  - ogromny pickup
3. Ram Pickup - j/w
4. Rav4 - sredni suv
5. Toyota camry - sredni sedan.

Juz nawet pomijam ilosci, gdzie top1 USA to wiecej sztuk niz top3 UE razem wziete.  Europejczycy nie kupuja masowo X7, GLS, Land cruiserow albo pickupow bo ich po prostu nie stac. Nawet te ""tansze"" duze SUV sa drogie, bo nie wiem kto poza desperatem zaplaci 350k za Forda.",0.090592794,0.8054816,0.10392549

"Out of your list I would recommend the Acura or buy the Mercedes for 0% interest and put the extra you save towards a maintenance fund (luxury car has luxury car maintenance). 

I can not in good faith recommend someone a Jeep Grand Cherokee, they are decent but the number of stupid things that just seem to start falling apart on every Jeep product I have ever worked on. I say this as a owner of several Jeeps past and present.

The Atlas is just kind of meh of a car there are better cars for the money. The VR6 seems to burn so much gas in the real world for the size of it I used to compare it to as bad as my old V8 Grand Cherokee. Plus since it is a VW they are good cars as long as you keep up on maintenance but they tend to have a higher cost of maintenance.

I have not worked on many Acuras so I can't really provide input on that one other then at its roots it's still a Honda and that is a good thing.

Also as a side note I would recommend extending your search to include 4 cylinders and look more at the HP and torque rating since now a day there are 4 cylinders with a good bit of punch in the mainstream. On top of the Highlanders and Pilots people are recommending maybe go check out a Subaru Outback XT. They are probably not as reliable as the Toyota but they definitely are not as bad as everyone jokes about anymore.

"Let me add to that this quip. 9 years ago I bought a white convertible vette in excellent shape low low miles from a friend and I got a screaming deal. 

I drove hot rods as a kid and unmarried grown up. 1970 Mustang Mach 1. 1978 z-28. 1983 Toyota Supra. Then got married. Drove suvs whilst childraising, of course that was great for gigging. 

My dad had a killer green 427 convertible vette when I was a kid. Mom made him sell it when I was turning 16. Vowed I would have a vette one day. 

So while picking up my son from school one day in the vette, one of his coaches says:Mid Life Crisis? 

I said no. I‚Äôm 54 it‚Äôs too late for a mid-life crisis. I‚Äôm passed mid-life. 

Coach: it‚Äôs never too late for a mid-life crisis. 

One year after buying that vette, I was approached near Austin by a fellow. Used to have one just like it. Made me an offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse. Called the banker, then went straight to the Chevy dealer and got a far nicer riding and far more brand new deluxe c7 vette. 63k miles in 8 years and I have not regretted either vette purchase. 

I will note t hat being past middle age, I was surprised at the ‚Äúflashings‚Äù I got from females when driving in Houston or Austin in the then 14 year old vette. I thought the dude that bought it from me was crazy spending as much as he did to buy that white 2000 vette but he wanted it.  Maybe the buyer was aware of the effect the c5 vette had on females.

"When the big three (well two, chrysler has not counted for a long time anymore) start cranking out ""every person cars/trucks"", Tesla is finished.

(Toyota probably could take chryslers place as big 3 if we want to skew domestic vs import classifications, but it has a serious problem with it's dealers lately forcing tastes on customers. Technically Chrysler doesn't count as ""domestic"" anymore since it's owned by Fiat. So drop toyota or honda in it's place then?)

Dark horizons are already in their arena with the F150 Lightning and GM is/has released a pickup also?

That's what will get lots of people into electric vehicles, when what they drive everyday has a electric drive train slid underneath it.

That's where tesla is failing. Look to the Cybertruck as a example. Had they designed one out of the gate that looked like a actual ""pickup truck"" and beefed up quality on the production line, they would be flying off the lots.

Doesn't matter that most own a pickup truck and pretty much carry a gallon of milk and a bucket of paint in it, that's what the market demands/is conditioned to buy, with the outliers being folks who actually use it as a truck for moving tons of construction gear, wood, concrete, etc etc.

A cybertruck does not look capable of doing any of that. Hell, if I had money laying around it would be a toss up between a F150 lightning or a Rivian. 

If I couldn't buy a Ford, then i'd probably settle for the Rivian. Little funky in the front end, but ""seems"" like it could do truck things vs just sit on a stage getting rocks thrown at it... Ahem",0.48032036,0.47253424,0.047145344

I've used the GREET model they reference, it's a nice tool, and I've worked together with the folks at Argonne many times, they're great.

The pertinent discrepancy is that your reference is comparing a Toyota Corolla at 33 MPG, and you're implicitly using that in your argument rather than the Toyota Prius I specified.  Even if you ignore the Prius Prime for a minute the best (other) Prius is 57 MPG IIRC. 

I recognize you said 'any gas car less efficient than a Prius', so we're talking a bit cross-ways from each other.

I didn't look into whether that GREET model was assuming CO2 from production, personally I (and others in the industry) have referenced the whitepaper from Volvo a few years back as a good reference on those numbers.  I haven't poked around in GREET for a year or two though, I'm sure it's been improved. 

So if we approximate the production CO2 hit for the gasoline vehicle (in the Volvo whitepaper it shows that's a reasonable assumption for a gasoline (or small-battery hybrid) vehicle), that means that the lifetime CO2 of the Prius will be around 2.7M grams of CO2, or approximately 35% better than the EV. That's a rough number, the analyses I've done in the past are 'only' around 20% IIRC.

I maintain that there's absolutely room to improve on a Tesla CO2 without even resorting to the (much cheaper and less damaging) Prius.  An equivalent analysis (again ignoring production CO2) would indicate equivalent CO2 is reached at about 37 MPG or thereabouts.  The EPA lists 54 gasoline vehicles for sale in 2023 above 40MPG, many of which are sub-variants, but most of which are not Prius-es.

For 35 MPG that number increases to 119 vehicles.  The Ford Maverick and Hyundai Tucson are in there as roughly equivalent to the Model3, and the Toyota Sienna is sadly 1 MPG shy.",0.021225728,0.15186012,0.82691413

"This is ignorant in at least 3 major ways.

&gt; what is going to stop a reseller from buying it new from a dealer then immediately flipping it to someone at a wholesale auction or retail auction site like Bring a Trailer for an inflated price? Nothing.

Dealers are already basically flippers. Private buyers would have a difficult time financing tens of thousands to flip. And re-sale would quickly fall when it goes to 2nd owner to 3rd owner. 

&gt;where are you going to get your warranty work done? Manufacturers still need a store front to service vehicles.

Service centers are [self-financing](https://b2b.kbb.com/dealer-resources/blog-posts/multipronged-approach-dealership-service-center-profits). Dealerships don't operate service centers out of the goodness of their heart to take care of their car buyers. They do it because it is independently profitable. 

&gt;Dealerships employ tons of people in your community and usually donate to local causes (sports teams, community events, etc).

Employing people to dig ditches isn't a good use of resources even if it provides jobs. Middle men should provide value. If what you're attempting to say (but not saying well) is that they are valuable, then they should be able to do operate as an industry without legislative protection. It's very simple. If dealerships provide value, then the laws we're talking about are redundant and it shouldn't matter if they're repealed. 

We all know that everyone hates dealerships and would happily buy directly from toyota if given the chance. That's market efficiency.

"I can tell you this about Toyota and the warranty with their paint. I have a 2011 Sienna that is my wife's daily driver and about 7 years ago we were still under the bumper to bumper warranty. I was washing it one day and I noticed several dull spots in the paint (white) under the drivers side sliding door. Well I started looking at the vehicle closer and noticed about 6 dull spots over the entire vehicle. I took it to the dealership where we purchased it and showed them, the service manager asked for me to come back in a couple of days when the district rep would be there.

"I live in a big Quebec, Canada city.  Our winter is closing off at the 5 month mark so safe to say we're very familiar with the cold + shitty roads.


I have a 2022 CLA 45 and this was my first winter (my only car). 


I see no risk of cracking the front bumper. Clearance is low but not terrible. At most, I've it blocks of semi solid snow with the front of the bumper, but those don't even leave scratches. 

In terms of winter performance, it actually performed better than my previous GLA 250 and my mom's GLC300. I'm thinking it's because of the 4matic+ (thos two others only have the most basic 4matic). It's pretty hard to lose control of the car. The only thing that annoys me is that I have no wiper for the rear window and I tend to shovel a bit of I leave it parked downtown since it's low. Not a dealbreaker at all though.

For potholes and such. You definitely have to dodge them. Although if you hit a few, you should be good. I will say though, during winter, the threat of potholes goes up  Snow and slush has this uncanny capability of hiding potholes. I had two flats on my front right tire within a week this winter. One of them I still don't know why (probably an object that ripped the tire) and the other one was a pothole hidden by the slush. Now, the tires are low profile, but I'm confident even my GLAs tire would've popped on a pothole as disgusting as that one. It has to get patched by the city next day. I run on 18"" during the winter at 19"" for the summer.


One thing you will notice is snow slushing around in the wheel wells while it's snowing. It's generates some sound and some vibration. Additionally, if your city passes salt, with the cold the suspension becomes so stiff you can feel the salt on the road through your ass, even on 18"" tires. 

Overall, if I had the choice between the GLC or the CLA 45, which would I pick having gone through the winter? Still the CLA. Sure the GLC will be more comfortable during winter, but the CLA isn't terrible. It's say the CLA is about as comfortable as the 2018+ Toyota's I ubered in occasionally during the winter. The CLA is just so much funnier when it's not snowing/spring comes around. I drive around with my cousin who has a GLC 63 and he can't keep up with how nimble the CLA is.

Edit : on the daily driver part, I'd like to add a few comments. 

1. I have no kids, but have transported 4-5 in the car. 4 people is just fine for average trips, 5 is pushing it.

2. I never had a space problem. I've popped the rear seats down and handled Ikea runs fine.Grocery runs work great, I keep trays in the back. + Winter gear

3. The suspension is stiff. Not the stiffed thing ever, but I'm a in my low 20s and I do notice it. I'd never give this car to my 60+ dad just for this reason. I don't mind it, I think it makes the drive more engaging, but if stiff suspension are something you mind, please test drive the car.

4. Windshield wiper runs out fast, the container is like 40% smaller than a regular car.",0.49968544,0.4079556,0.092359

When a metal component meant for safety is bent like that, even when straightened, the metal will never have the same safety comformity again.  Due to the stretching of the metal.

"I am working on my car, which is a sixth generation Toyota Camry. She's been great to me..so far. Mine in particular is a 2008.

The  issue pertains to the HVAC system. While hot (and cold) air does   flow  through the lateral driver/passenger window vents and the front  windshield defrost vents, air does not flow through the two center vents  above the stereo.

After watching  several YouTube videos that cover various vehicle   types (including an  older generation of Toyota Camry), I decided I would try and dive in to  learn more about the problem. I've learned more   about my car than I  ever thought I would.

I removed  the glove compartment and the plastic trim behind the glove    compartment. I could see the blend and defrost mode actuator assembly,  but I removed the passenger foot vent to get more visibility on the  actuator assembly.

Even though I  changed from defrost mode to other modes with the mode   dial on the A/C  Climate Control Unit, the actuator and gears did not   turn to open up  the center vent to allow air through the center dash vents above the  stereo. Thus, it looks like the Camry A/C system is stuck in defrost  mode. I can feel cold air coming out of the window vents a little.

So here's where I need advice..   üôÉ

I  have looked all over the web for instructions on how to complete the  repair. Removing the old HVAC Defrost Mode Actuator, and installing the  new one.

To be honest, I've a lot  of time looking for installation instructions on lining up the gears and  whatnot for the install. I'm not   sure if the Climate Control Unit  needs to be set to a certain mode for  the repair, how to line things  up, ect.

Any repair/installation advice and instructions would be greatly appreciated!

If Used, you'll want to have that company's contact info handy. As well as any original paperwork for the battery. You may need to transfer the battery warranty to your name right away else the warranty will be void.(Depending on the company)

"You are right. Sorry.

Yesterday, we were approved jointly by our FCU for $12,000. My husband's credit is why. It is 720. He has worked at his job for 12 years. My credit is recovering. It is 500. My employment is 2 years. My debt to income was 85% by myself. I do not have our combined info with me.

It was split interest, if that is how you say that. 2010 to 2016 vehicles would have a 7.99% rate, 2017-2024 vehicles would have 7.49%. 84 months.

We wanted a small SUV or sedan for $8,500 MSRP. 2010-2016, with about 150,000 miles, looked about right price-wise online. With whatever fees, I expected $10,000-$11,000 on the loan. I wanted $150/month but was willing to go to $200/month. We preferred Honda, Toyota, maybe Nissan.

We had no trade-in and no down payment. 100% finance. We had refinanced a debt consolidation loan with our FCU last year, and they were missing paperwork we had paid off the high interest loan from that. We had that papwork.

They got us in an MSRP $23,000 2018 GMC Acadia, with 73,000 miles. $443/month. 84 months. 2 previous owners, 1 minor accident with cosmetic damage.

"Yeah.. That's old news. There will always be issue with new cars. Toyota still has gearbox leaking issues and while they're almost always fixed during the first couple of services it's far more common and niggling than anyone would like to admit. Toyotas ADAS features are some of the worst in the industry and there a class action lawsuits equivalent in the European courts regarding this. Nissan on the other hand does not have these issues... You see every manufacturer has teething issues based on market and segment. In fact as I was reading Toyota failed in the Indian market because of reliability issues. Nissan was outselling them until recently 27:1. How does that make sense? Issues are there and will always be there. 

Toyota ranks pretty low on user satisfaction for the 5.7 for 2023. The new sequoia is a poorly rated product and it does not have the V8 any more... They are phasing it out rather quickly as it's not viable for them to continue with it because of power and consumption. 

Nissans regularly make it past a million too. So does Mitsubishi and Isuzu. I don't see why it's such a big deal. Hell I've seen Ford go passed 750k, it was a diesel though. Calling an advantage based on relatively outdated technology is just a ticking time bomb. When the change comes, Toyota will struggle, just like they did in 2009 with the camry. They've all had terrible years and with they dynamic shifting industry regulations, I see Toyota making the mistakes others did before they rectified it. The biggest one being a drop in build quality of their non Japanese lineup.",0.7744751,0.2091823,0.016342523
"&gt;Temat suv√≥w i crossover√≥w wyp≈ÇynƒÖ≈Ç bo sƒÖ one nadreprezentatywnie reklamowane, promowane, wciskane wszystkim, zastƒôpujƒÖc wcze≈õniejsze samochody rodzinne takie jak eurovany. Ka≈ºda znaczƒÖca marka ma kilka linii suv√≥w i crossover√≥w, a nawet zmienia nadwozia aut sportowych na crossovery. Z tego wzglƒôdu sƒÖ one popularne. Dlatego rozmawiamy o tym wyjƒÖtkowym typie nadwozia. Bo jest on popularny. Poza tym sp√≥jrz na temat posta opa

No jest popularny bo ludziom sie podoba. Czy mi sie podobaja pickupy i crossovery? Niespecjalnie, a jesli juz to dopiero te co maja poprawne proporcje, tj. wszystkie male crossovery (ala crosover golfa) odpadaja. Ale nie bede zakazywal ludziom kupowania tego czego chca.

&gt;To trendy sƒÖ takie, ≈ºe samochody sƒÖ ciƒô≈ºsze i wiƒôksze. Crossovery i suvy sƒÖ wypadkowƒÖ tych trend√≥w. Generalnie moim zdaniem zmotoryzowanie spo≈Çecze≈Ñstwa powinno siƒô ograniczaƒá i tych samochod√≥w na drogach powinno byƒá mo≈ºliwie jak najmniej. Powinno siƒô minimalizowaƒá ich wp≈Çyw na ≈õrodowisko przyrodnicze jak i miejskie. Moim zdaniem idzie to w z≈Çym kierunku. I samochody elektryczne ten problem jeszcze pog≈ÇƒôbiƒÖ.

No i tu sie juz nie zgodzimy, a przynajmniej nie do konca. Ograniczanie samochodow W MIASTACH jest jak najbardziej ok. A szczegolnie poprzez wykorzystywanie rozwiazan ktore mozemy juz znalezc na swiecie, tj:

\- Chcesz miec auto w miescie, to masz miec dla niego wykupione lub wynajete miejsce parkingowe.  Nie masz miejsca, nie masz auta.

\- Ograniczenia w postaci zakazu wjazdow aut z odpowiednimi normami. I tu chodzi g≈Çownie zeby w miastach nie jedzily auta typu zardziewialy VW transporter z wycietym katalizatorem.

Jak powyzsze jest spelnione, to nie widze roznicy czy ktos jezdzi X5 czy Toyota Yaris.

&gt;Czemu tych samoch√≥d siƒô nie zmniejsza, czemu wiele dobrych motoryzacyjnych trend√≥w z lat 90 i 00 po prostu wrzucono do kosza.

Wyrzucono te trendy bo sie nie przyjely. Vany i Eurovany dla wiekszosci ludzi sa paskudne, a ludzie lubia ladne rzeczy. SUVy maja podobne wlasciwosci a maja zdecydownanie ladniejsze linie nadowzia.

&gt;Co nam po tym, ≈ºe sƒÖ coraz nowsze standardy ekonomii silnik√≥w kiedy to wszystko niwelujemy budujƒÖc wiƒôksze i ciƒô≈ºsze samochody. Abominacje takie jak mustang-e czy hummer ev to ≈õwiadectwo podej≈õcia bran≈ºy motoryzacyjnej do problem√≥w, poprzez ich ignorowanie.

Mustang-e nie ma specjalnie wiekszego zuzycia energii niz inne elektryki. Elektryki ze wzgledu na nadwozie sa w ogole marginalnie ciezsze miedzy soba, glownie poprzez ogromna wage baterii. Zapewne nowe A6 Kombi ktore ma byc elektryczne bedzie ciezsze niz wiele aut ktore wyminieles w postach wyzej, skoro ma miec 700km zasiegu (czyli \~400).  A hummer EV to samochod mem. Ile tego bedzie jezdzic w USA 5000 sztuk? W europie zero, bo go nie ma i nie bedzie.

&gt;Wskazywa≈Çem w dyskusji wiele kwestii kt√≥re dotyczƒÖ wszystkich nowych samochod√≥w takie jak wiƒôksze s≈Çupki, agresywniejsze linie maski i wy≈ºsze maski.  
&gt;  
&gt;*A bo to przez to ≈ºe samochody sƒÖ bezpieczniejsze*  
&gt;  
&gt;No chyba, ≈ºe znajdujƒô siƒô poza takim samochodem, to ju≈º nie bardzo. Jest to forma ""greenwashingu"" ale tym razem wycierajƒÖc sobie mordƒô bezpiecze≈Ñstwem, a nie ≈õrodowiskiem.

Czepiles sie tych pieszych i rodzajow aut. Nie mam takich danych, ani nie bede szukal, ale nie ciezko stwierdzic ze w Polsce wplyw SUV i Crossow na wypadkowosc na przejsciach jest znikoma. Wiekszosc aut w PL ma 10 i wiecej, a to nie sa lata super popularnosci tego typu aut w europie jeszcze. I ludzie nadal gina i sa ranieni. Busow i Tirow tez nie ograniczysz, ani sie nie czepiasz.

Chcesz sie zajac bezpieczenstwem na drogach to sugeruje zaczac od postulowania o zwiekszenie kontrol i patroli na drogach, bo co z tego ze sa mandaty jak na zachodzie jak wykrywalnosc jest znikoma?

Side streets in residential areas without clear lane markings don‚Äôt work that well with so many obstacles. 

City streets just driving with no time limit are great, but I find when I am in a rush, I am needing to constantly accelerate and change lanes to keep moving along. You have to be comfortable tuning your settings in order to get a good acceleration and following distance. 

Arterial roads with lane markings and no parked cars work amazing. Depending on the car and corner, you may have steering issues and speed disengagement.

&gt;California is dumping record amounts of renewable electricity each month because it can't be used. 

And California is the world now? Or a cherry picked place because it fits your narrative?

&gt;The ""efficiency"" argument you make is literally so dumb 

Ok, what's the reasoning behind it being dumb? 

&gt;If efficiency was an issue we wouldn't use oil

Oil has a COP that's flat out amazing.  Put 1kWh of energy into oil production and you get roughly 10kWh of useable energy back. That's not a reason to keep it, obviously. Thing is that oil and gas are still dirt cheap. Electricity is more expensive,  so better use it more economically efficient,  and that means more technically efficient as well.

What about the available of renewables? Yes, h2 has a place there! Absolutely.  Even seasonal storage. But personal transportation? It's not happening,  literally  it's not happening. Just scroll back this sub 5 years or so and thst industry is pretty much where it was back then.

&gt;Toyota Mirai because they both use lithium ion batteries.

Are you sure about that? Non plug in hybrids don't use lithium ion batteries. Only the PHEV version of the Priusses use lithium ion batteries, the other ones use NiMH. They're way better at handling many many cycles and can produce more curremt with smaller battery packs. 1.25kWh is a tiny battery, it's very challenging to get 30kW out (or in) of that using lithium ion. 30kW is roughly what what you need need for regen breaking.

&gt;You sound like a Tesla stan.

Nice, ad hominem... 

&gt;The ""efficiency"" argument you make is literally so dumb i'm tempted to just block anyone who uses it at this point.

That's just childish.

"What taxpayer money?  The Boring Co is not receiving any taxpayer money for the 65 mile, 69 station Vegas Loop. Or are you trying to conflate other companies of Musk‚Äôs being subsidised with the Boring Co?

If so, even that is a flawed argument as other companies have received far more subsidies than Tesla or SpaceX. 

- GM alone has received 628 Federal and State subsides and loan and Bailout awards of $55 Billion dollars compared to Tesla's $2.8 Billion (all of which Tesla paid back early with interest)
- $80 Billion bailout of the Big Three US automotive manufacturers which ended up in a $10 Billion hit to the US Treasury.
- $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, in subsidies to Toyota, Nissan and VW in Mississippi and Tennessee. 
- $836 million to Toyota from Mississippi, Texas and Kentucky.
- $2.3 billion in state and local incentives given to GM in 2009 
- $7.8 billion since 1984 to GM, Ford, Chrysler and Mazda in Michigan.

And of course who could forget the mind-boggling $5.2 Trillion per year that the Fossil fuel industry gets in subsidies globally - a gob-smacking 6% of global GDP.

And then there is SpaceX. Being paid money in a contract for provision of a service or product is not a subsidy.

And in fact the govenment has continuously paid SpaceX far less to develop their spacecraft than they pay to competitors who they are in the pockets of like the old boys of aerospace Boeing, Northrop Grumman, etc.  SpaceX was only paid $2.6b to develop Crew Dragon while Boeing got almost double at $4.8b for Starliner (which still doesn‚Äôt work) and SpaceX only gets $55m for seats on Crew Dragon to the ISS vs NASA paying Boeing $90m per seat (if they ever get off the ground that is!).

SpaceX has saved NASA and the American taxpayer between $20 - $30 billion dollars - the Constellation program was going to cost. 

SpaceX also received only $135 million, Dynetics got $253 million, and Blue Origin's National Team of Old Space chums got $579 million for stage 1 of the Artemis Moon Lander program.

"I kind of feel there needs to be a distinction between traditional old school SUVs built on truck platforms like the Chevrolet Suburban and crossovers like the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4.  The former are the ones that guzzle gas, while the latter are built on car platforms that get fuel economy on par with traditional cars.  Crossovers for the most part are pretty much tall station wagons or minivans (depending on the size class) with slightly higher ground clearance.  

In North America, manufacturers have been pairing down their line-ups of traditional cars, so they are filled with pick-ups and SUVs (with some minivans).  A few years ago, Ford explicitly said they would stop selling traditional cars outside of the Mustang, but other manufacturers have appeared to have followed suit.  The Malibu is the last non-performance car outside of the Camaro and Corvette in Chevrolet's line-up, and it is slated to be discontinued.  The Mirage is the only car in Mitsubishi's North American line-up, and its future is up in the air, given it has been discontinued in its home country of Japan.

Kei trucks essentially never become a thing because of this in the US.

All these immensely useful (and popular) trucks become prohibitively expensive in the US. And, in the process the race goes on for larger and larger trucks.

"I have a 22 AWD XLE with about 25 thousand miles on it. Mix highway/ city and have done multiple long trips. Owned over a year.   Overall impressions are very good.  The quality and drive are nice and if i don't gas it and drive generally conservatively i can easily get over 30 mpg with some tanks being close to 33 mpg. Lower in winter with the lowest average being around 28.

The safety features are very nice and the adaptive cruise and blind spot monitoring are exceptional.

The bad (this is annoying to me but not deal breakers).

The space usage inside is tight. Not a lot of cubbies or rear room. It's rough with four adults and VERY tight on long trips.  

The factory rack is very overpriced and doesn't carry much.

The rails peeled in the winter when it was very cold and Toyota says it's not a problem....

The AWD is not as competent as Subarus I've had but work fine on the road. Off road is iffy.

The engine is not powerful. While it gets the gas mileage i wanted it's definitely hairy trying to merge sometimes.  I'm ok with that given the gas mileage but it's worth noting.

I'm 5'10"" and on long trips the front seat bottom let's my legs hang over the edge.  Compared to BMWs I've had it's annoying.

The CVT/road noise is noticable and droney but you can manage this fairly easily if you pay attention to the terrain.

Finally the Android Auto is not that quick and since you HAVE to plug it in and there's only one (?!???) USB port on the front that means NOBODY else can use the stereo except the phone that is using maps.

That means NOBODY else can play music they may have and MUST use the drivers phone to access the system.  I've never had another car like this and it's a big oversight.

Overall I'm VERY happy with it.  I miss the seat heaters from Volvo, the seat length from BMW, the rear trunk usability from Subaru, the off road confidence from Subaru and a few other details like the stereo, but generally I've had ZERO engine issues and it drives and operates exceptionally well for the price point.

"An '05 Land Cruiser or LX470 uses a 2nd gen Toyota immobilizer system, and the process to steal them would be (a) pretty lengthy (like 30 minutes of actively working on the car with professional diagnostic tools) or (b) a faster but more sophisticated method than the average tweaker/car thief would be capable off. And sophisticated car thieves usually target luxury cars to be exported to other countries. A cruiser is more likely to be stolen than say a RAV4 but still isn't likely to be targeted by these kinds of thieves imo.


Just breaking the ignition and driving off is not possible due to the immobilizer system.


If you just bought it and are worried about the previous owner holding on to a key, go to an automotive locksmith (like me) and have them reset the key count and program in whatever keys you have on hand.

"The ‚ÄúWinning vs Losing‚Äù issue is really viewed differently under the U.S. model.

For example, here‚Äôs this base in Syria, right? And in Iraq there are now *twelve* U.S. military bases.

So look at it this way: If someone has established military bases within your own country as part of their massive, distributed global defense network, would you say they‚Äôd ‚Äúlost‚Äù a war? They have *their bases* in *your country*. To that defense network, that *is* ‚Äúwinning‚Äù. Those bases are nodes in its global logistics network.

"I think it is important to stop looking at batteries &amp; fuel cells as dichotomies where we choose one or the other.   Batteries and fuel cells work best together as complimentary technologies.   Both are basically the same thing:  an anode, a cathode, and an electrolyte with no moving parts.  The only difference between a battery cell and a fuel cell is that one stores energy internally and one externally.   A Toyota Mirai has a 1.25kWh lithium-ion battery and a 400 mile range.  A Hummer electric has a 212kWh lithium-ion battery and a range of 329 miles.   You could make 170 Toyota Mirais with the same amount of battery material as 1 Hummer.   In this sense, the environmental question is an easy one.   It takes enormous amounts of fossil fuels to make battery packs and keep them charged.

We can make hydrogen with just about anything:  garbage, animal farm waste, by product of industry, solar green, wind green, nuclear pink, and more.   If the average commute of a regular driver is about 40 miles per day we don't need to be wasting resources making battery packs that are so large.

"Toyota raced in F1 back in the early 2000s, as a full manufacturer with their own engines and everything. They also supplied engines to Williams and Jordan (the team that eventually became Aston Martin). They reportedly spent more than any other F1 team at the time, but never really came out with much to show for it. They were a solid upper midfield team and got a handful of podiums, but never a win.

In the end they quit F1 in 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis at the time, at a similar time to Honda and BMW deciding to cut costs, as the F1 team was too expensive to keep running without getting good enough results. Some of their F1 team's facilities are still used to this day, in particular the wind tunnel in Cologne is used by McLaren for developing and testing their car.

I don't remember hearing any word from them one way or another about F1 in recent years, but I imagine they were too burned last time around to want to return. Much like Honda, they're a lot more focused on electric/hybrid cars these days, so F1 wouldn't really fit their image/marketing, on top of the failure last time around.

JD Power is hardly trustworthy. For [2022 rankings](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-us-initial-quality-study-iqs), Dodge is near the top of the table while Chrysler is at the bottom. Rather strange for two brands that share so many parts and components. This is in addition to JD power ranking Chevy above Lexus, and Nissan above Toyota.

"I have been a BMW owner since 2006. I had a 2001 740il, my younger sister who lived with me had a 2003 325ci (e46) but I helped maintain it for her, and now I have a 2019 m850i. The one I drove the most was the 7 series which I bought at 70k miles and drove to 170k miles. I also have friends who have owned various Toyotas and we‚Äôve compared notes over the years.

We found that BMWs don‚Äôt necessarily need _more_ maintenance or repairs than a Toyota does over its lifetime (they are pretty damn reliable) but that it‚Äôs maintenance and repairs are more expensive. How much more expensive also changes depending on the model you buy - the 3 series my sister owned was _far_ cheaper than the 7 series, which itself was far cheaper than the m850i I have now.

The numbers I‚Äôm giving you below are from the 7 series when compared to Toyotas, and prices of _just_ the parts because I worked on that one myself and know the prices off the top of my head. The BMW e46 will be cheaper, but this should give you an idea of the differences to look for.

‚Äî

My friends were paying $50 for their Toyota oil changes, I was paying about $180. BMW engines require more quarts of more expensive oil.

My fiends were paying $100-150 per tire for a tire change, I was paying $400-450 because the 740il needed performance tires rated to handle its top speed, _and_ buying 5 tires because the spare was a full size and not a donut. And it‚Äôs worth noting that on my newest BMW (2019 m850i) the front and back wheels are different sizes for better grip but it also means I can‚Äôt rotate them to make them last longer (doesn‚Äôt apply to you, just being thorough).

My friend replaced his alternator for $50 and it took about 20 minutes of work. I replaced mine with a rebuilt one for $180 and it took us 2 hours, because the 740il alternator was water cooled so we had to remove the front fan and drain the entire coolant system to change it.

A replacement Toyota fuel filter costs about $20, a BMW one about $80.

A replacement windshield for a Toyota costs maybe $300. You can go to any auto glass shop and they likely will have one in stock. Every BMW I had had a rain sensor and some special coatings on the windshield to reduce glare, and every glass shop I asked said that there were no aftermarket windshields available. So a replacement windshield on my 7 series cost me $3000 in New York (but only $1200 in Milwaukee). Likewise a new side mirror is $400-$500 if you hit it.

I would research the prices of things like this on an e46 today, check eBay or call up a mechanic and ask what they‚Äôd charge, and see if the prices are acceptable to you. If they are, then go BMW. The e46 is really a great car.",0.050648693,0.7321339,0.21721743

"So I will go through my convoluted way of thinking. I bought a 2020 Lariat Ford F150 Super Crew FX4 that was awesome but got about 18mpg. I didn't really need a pickup and I got stupid money for it while trading it in on a 2022 Lexus NX 350h premium. Once I got the Lexus I realized it was just too small. I was fortunate that I went to the Toyota Dealer that happens to have a Lexus dealership as well. They had just gotten in the night before a 2023 Highlander Hybrid bronze edition. I got great money for my Lexus toward the Highlander which was at msrp so I was happy with that. Anyway the Highlander is a decent SUV that has been getting great mileage for me.

"Easy to find parts. Like, front to back, the de-crapification would go like this:

- Replace factory lights with a negatively switched headlight harness. $20 on Amazon and $10 for lights and you get functional lights. 

- Oil, filter, air filter, spark plugs, spark plug wires. Unless somebody did something really janky or weird with the engine, this is all gonna set you back... $80 or $100? I run iridium plugs and Denso wires, synthetic oil and extended Mobil1 filter. Runs fine on all of that. And keeps me outta the hood.

- Swap out the front brakes with Tundra rotors and calipers. Search ""Tundra brake swap."" $350ish for me to do this. This is a factory Toyota part, and you can just get calipers out of a scrapyard if you want. This helps a ton if you tow or operate at altitude.

- If it's been over 100K since done last, replace front water pump, timing belt, radiator. About $1000 here.

- Front suspension. Bilstein 5100s, OME springs of your choice. Make sure your LBJ's are good and steering box isn't leaking. Toss anything that isn't Bilstein, OME, or factory.

- If you get an auto, swap out the intercooler with a separate radiator.

- Make sure the rear heater core lines are intact

- Swap out the power antenna for a fixed Tacoma whip

- Swap out the head unit with something bluetooth compatible

- Bilstein 5100's in the rear, along with OME 891/890 or 906 springs.

- Swap out tires for KO2's.

"Contrived statistics for COTA: (TL;DR at bottom)

I'm basing this on the last 10 Cup road course races, as COTA had only had 2 events.

So of the last 10 road course winners in Cup: 

2/10 were former Cup champions. Both of which were the defending series champion

7/10 Had a prior win on a road course in Cup. The other three were first time winners.

4/10 Had a road course win in the Xfinity or truck series. None had a road course win in both.

Exactly 1 of the last 10 winners was the defending race winner.

3/10 won a race in Cup the previous year*

6/10 Had a win in Cup already that year. 

4/10 Had won a pole in Cup the previous year.

5/10 Made the Cup series playoffs the previous year 

And Chevy has been insanely dominant winning 9/10 road course races, Toyota has won 1/10, which means Ford has 0 wins in the last 10 road courses. (Ford last Road Course win was Ryan Blaney at the Roval in 2018).

*Kyle Larson won 2 RC races in 2021 which I think may skew the stats a bit as he was suspended for 2020. 

So if we're going by the dominant trends, we're looking for a driver who: is not a former cup champion, has a prior win on a road course in Cup, did not have a cup win the last year, is not the defending race winner, &amp; drives a Chevy.

There is only 1 driver who meets this criteria: AJ Allmendinger.

However, if Kyle Larson had not been suspended in 2020 I think he would have won at least one race, and that would bring the ""won a race last year"" stat to 5/10. So I'm going to include those that had a win last year AND meet the rest of the criteria.

So now we include

Daniel Suarez

But I'll also include Christopher Bell, because since the beginning of 2020 only twice has a non-chevy won at a road course, and both times it was Christopher Bell (Daytona RC '21 &amp; Roval '22).

And if we get a first time winner, then Noah Gragson fits the bill perfectly. 

(TL;DR: Allmendinger fits the dominant trends, however they may have been skewed by Kyle Larson's suspension in 2020. If I account for that Daniel Suarez also meets the trends. C.Bell is dark horse pick because he's the only non-chevy road course winner in the last 3 seasons.)",0.029330056,0.9054508,0.06521918

"There are several theories but AFAIK, Toyota has never explicitly explained this practice. Typically you'll get NGK on one side of the V and Denso on the other, and it's somewhat random.

I've read several times on the Tacoma forums that the spark plugs have opposite polarities, but you can look up both model numbers of the factory plugs and they'll be 100% equivalent plugs. On 4th gen Tacos, one side of the V always fires standard polarity plugs with reversed polarity so people have assumed that one of the brands performed better when being fired with reversed polarity, but the fact that you can regularly find NGK/Denso installed by the factory on the driver's side or passenger side at random seems to defeat this theory.

The theory that sounds more likely to me is that  because of Japan's ""keiretsu"" laws, Toyota must use both suppliers of spark plugs instead of using a single brand. These laws enforce equal opportunities for corporations in Japan in an effort to promote economic diversity and discourage monopolies. This also ensures that Toyota will be able to continue production if one brand encounters a supply/quality problem.",0.348434,0.6284597,0.02310628

"Much more physical racing. NASCAR cars are basically tanks. They can be hit fairly hard and keep running competitively. No real track limits, and the racing ‚Äúdecorum‚Äù is very different from F1. Expect drivers to shove each other off the track, pass through the grass, or wrecking each other. Also expect much more parity. Despite this usually being one of the less-competitive races, probably 60% of the field has a respectable shot of winning. Also, NASCAR has stage racing- the race is broken up into three stages. Additional points go to the top ten finishers at the end of each stage, which generally leads to competitive racing around the midpoints of the race. 

The cars are virtually identical, but there are both manufacturers (Ford, Chevy, Toyota) and teams. Some operations are one car operations, while others have as many as four drivers. Kimi is driving for TrackHouse Racing. His teammates will be Ross Chastain (number 1) and Daniel Su√°rez (#99), both have won at similar tracks (Chastain won here last year). Jenson Button (#15) is driving for Rick Ware Racing, a shitbox team (think Marussia or 2020 Williams). His teammate is the 51 of Cody Ware. 

In terms of storylines for this race and this season, the 2020 champion, Chase Elliott (#9), broke his leg snowboarding and is out indefinitely. He‚Äôs been replaced for this race by sports car racer Jordan Taylor, who has qualified 4th. His teammate, William Byron (#24), has won two of the first five races this season and has qualified on the pole here. However, his championship hopes have been damaged by inconsistency and a points penalty given to his team Hendrick Motorsports for an improper part. 

Other contenders to watch for this race include Tyler Reddick (#45), who was the fastest car in practice and starts second; Austin Cindric (#2), a talented road racer; Michael McDowell (#34), who always runs well at road courses; Kyle Busch (#8), who is having a resurgence under a new team; Kyle Larson (#5) the 2021 series champion; and A.J. Allmendinger (#16), who won a lower division race here yesterday.

El piloto del **JP Carrera** alcanz√≥ as√≠ su **1¬™ victoria en 43 carreras** en la categor√≠a, un triunfo que lleg√≥ luego del recargo de 5 segundos a **Marcos Landa** (Torino), ganador en la pista y penalizado por haber superado al balcarce√±o con bandera amarilla. As√≠, **Chevrolet cort√≥ una racha de 11 competencias sin triunfos**.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú**_Cuando me bajaron la bandera todav√≠a no sab√≠a que hab√≠a ganado_**. _Cuando hac√≠a los trompos de festejo, todav√≠a no lo pod√≠a creer. No ten√≠amos el potencial para ganar, pero Mat√≠as_ (Rossi) _no s√© qu√© problema tuvo y Marcos_ (Landa) _me pas√≥ con bandera amarilla, y se nos dio a nosotros_. **_Creo que √©l est√° bien sancionado, pero hay que reconocerle el m√©rito de que gan√≥ en la pista_**‚Äù, asever√≥ el ‚ÄúBochita‚Äù, que es el **220¬∫ ganador en la historia** del Turismo Carretera.
&gt; 
&gt; Bajo un constante acoso de Ciantini, **Mat√≠as Rossi** (Toyota), que larg√≥ desde la ¬´pole position¬ª, **comand√≥ la competencia hasta la 17¬™ vuelta**, cuando se detuvo en los boxes para el repostaje. Luego de que los principales protagonistas cumplieron con la detenci√≥n obligatoria (casi todos lo hicieron en la 1¬™ oportunidad que tuvieron), el ‚ÄúMisil‚Äù se mantuvo como el l√≠der virtual de la carrera con el ¬´Bochita¬ª, que hab√≠a largado 2¬∫, como escolta.
&gt; 
&gt; Landa, que larg√≥ 9¬∫ y estaba 6¬∫ antes de abrirse la ventana de los boxes, qued√≥ 3¬∫ entre los que peleaban por la victoria al cumplir la gran mayor√≠a de ellos con la recarga de combustible. En apenas 2 giros, **el uruguayo super√≥ con dos grandes maniobras a Ciantini (29¬™ vuelta) y a Rossi (30¬™)**. De all√≠ en m√°s, se mantuvo al frente y cruz√≥ la meta en la 1¬™ posici√≥n. Pero a metros de la bandera a cuadros, Landa y el **Trotta Racing Team** fueron notificados de que Marcos estaba recargado y que el ganador era Ciantini.
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú**_En el momento no vimos la maniobra. La gente del JP Carrera nos vino a avisar._** **_Buscamos la maniobra y cuando la encontramos, faltaban 2 vueltas_**_. La revisamos y cuando estuvimos seguros, le avisamos a Landa. No pod√≠amos hacer otra cosa_‚Äù, explic√≥ **Carlos Garrido**, uno de los comisarios deportivos de Toay junto a Mariano Calamante, en **Campeones Radio y AM590 Continental.**
&gt; 
&gt; ‚Äú_Fue un carrer√≥n, largamos 9¬∫ y pasamos autos en la pista, que es lo importante._ **_Duele esto porque es muy dif√≠cil ganar en el TC. Prefiero no hablar de la sanci√≥n. Siento impotencia por no poder levantar el trofeo en lo m√°s alto del podio_**‚Äù, indic√≥ Landa, que confirm√≥ que le avisaron del recargo en la 40¬™ y √∫ltima vuelta, es decir, 11 despu√©s de que sucedi√≥ la maniobra que cambi√≥ el rumbo de la competencia.
&gt; 
&gt; Algunos minutos despu√©s, algo m√°s tranquilo, Landa volvi√≥ a hablar en **Campeones**: ‚Äú_No me reprocho nada. Corr√≠ para ganar y gan√© en la pista. N_**_unca vi la bandera amarilla. No digo que est√© mal la sanci√≥n_**‚Äù, se√±al√≥ el piloto rioplatense, que debi√≥ conformarse con su **4¬∫ podio en 33 carreras** en TC.
&gt; 
&gt; Por su parte, **Esteban Trotta**, titular del equipo que representa a la Asociaci√≥n de Concesionarios Renault Argentina, se mostr√≥ visiblemente abatido por el recargo a Landa. ‚Äú**_No quiero hablar. Todo lo que ten√≠a que decir se lo dije a los comisarios. Son cosas que te tiran para atr√°s_**‚Äù, declar√≥ en **Campeones Radio y AM590 Continental.**
&gt; 
&gt; **Gast√≥n Mazzacane** (Chevrolet), que larg√≥ 7¬∫, complet√≥ el ‚Äú1-3‚Äù de Chevrolet y **cort√≥ una racha de 15 carreras sin terminar entre los 3 mejores** en una Final. _‚ÄúEstoy feliz de volver al podio y de que Chevrolet vuelva a ser competitivo_‚Äù, manifest√≥ el ‚ÄúRayo‚Äù, que cosech√≥ su **13¬∫ podio en 193 carreras** en el Turismo Carretera.
&gt; 
&gt; Despu√©s de la 1¬™ carrera especial de la temporada, **el nuevo l√≠der del campeonato de TC es Mariano Werner** (Ford), que parti√≥ 4¬∫ y termin√≥ en la misma posici√≥n en Toay. El entrerriano tiene 9,5 puntos de ventaja sobre **Juan Tom√°s Catal√°n Magni** (Ford), que lleg√≥ 14¬∫ tras largar 19¬∫.
&gt;

No, it needs to be somewhere more central and accessible to good public transit, not somewhere inaccessible unless you have a car.

Not to mention why would you build a City of Kitchener owned thing in Waterloo? ;-)

Some American 20k stadiums are on plots of land as small as the Charles St bus terminal, but truck access there is tricksy.

We could sacrifice some of the outdoor amenities and parking lots at the current Aud to build a modern stadium that could handle both sports and concerts, then demolish the old one and rebuild the amenities. That wouldn't require buying new land but would take extra long.

If we're OK with expropriations, we could stick it between the end of Joseph St and the GEXR spur that heads south to connect with CPR to Toyota.

1. Salary sacrifice for higher end ev cars like Tesla 3 performance

"If they gouge people for a ‚Äúnew car‚Äù they might get in trouble with Toyota. Manufacturers track what dealerships are charging for new cars, so throwing on a floor mat package and adjusting the price by $15k may draw ire from Toyota and impact future allocations.

If they gouge people for a ‚Äúused car‚Äù it‚Äôs the market dictating the price, not the dealer‚Äôs fault *technically*.

It‚Äôs semantics. Someone close to the dealership buys it new and sells it back ‚Äúused‚Äù immediately. Now the sky is the limit for price because of the *market* and the dealer can rip people off in a way that less likely to get them in trouble with Toyota.

It‚Äôs similar to purposely messing up the packages when someone orders a desirable model through the dealership. Honest mistake right?

But I've driven a couple of different family and friends' cars (namely Nissans and Toyotas) and can tell you that to me, none have felt as responsive and better feeling than the Mazdas I've driven. If I had to guess, the stereotype is probably driven by how Mazda's tech is, in some people's perspective, ""behind"" when you see all these other cars with haptic buttons, touchscreens, 6 speed autos vs CVTs, weird climate controls. As someone who absolutely loves technological advancement and hopes to be in an IT related field soon, I can tell you that Mazda has it right though. Look at the new gen infotainment system for example compared to other cars, sure it doesn't have touchscreen or an extensive menu, but it feels like part of the car, rather than a tablet that came with it. It has the functionality that you need and nothing extra, no having to go through a bunch of menus to adjust your seats or vents. Everything else you need is in carplay/android auto. So, in my opinion, Mazdas have a good balance of introducing the right amount of tech into their cars to not be completely behind in the industry without having all the other unnecessary stuff, which might give it a reputation of being for older people that want something safe. So, depending on your own perspective, that may be a good or bad thing. Don't let a stigma stop you from buying a car that you'll enjoy though.",0.048787624,0.26306272,0.68814963

"Without getting into the super nitty gritty of engine efficiency, think of it like this: When your engine is cold, it has to spend more gas heating the coolant (in the engine, radiator, and cabin heater) and itself up to temperature. This is important because it reduces the amount of wear that happens to everything (but don't let your car idle in park until its warmed up, this is bad because there's no ""load"" on the engine, so it takes longer). Once everything is warmed up, then everything becomes super efficient since you don't have to use that extra gas.

For an example of how extreme this is, I drive a Smart Fortwo (hilarious, since I'm a Toyota tech). My drive to work is only 3km. If I only drive to and from work, I get around 20mpg. If I spend a day driving to another town and then back, I tend to get around 35-40mpg. Cold engines use up a lot of gas.",0.116829775,0.66833824,0.21483196

Also, just because you can afford a suped up or decked out luxury car doesn't mean you should. Cars generally and historically have been a terrible investment and most people are better served by buying a car that falls into the middle of their affordability band.

7. Silent parking lot and frequent periods of highway EV mode.... Just like the Tesla

"I'm 6'8"", mostly torso, and have just started shopping for a new car. I've been in an SUV or full-sized truck for a while, and I'd like something I can park without having to think about it. Being able to move fast or be nimble on the road would be nice, too. So I've gone to a few dealerships in the past few weeks and asked whether I could test-sit a few models.

For what's out there today, my two options thus far seem to be the Chevy Bolt or the Honda Accord (as long as the Accord doesn't have a sunroof, which takes away headroom).

In addition to the above, so far, I've tried on the Toyota Camry and Tacoma, Audi A6, Acura TLX, Lexus ES, and Subaru Impreza. My head has hit the roof in all of them, and my shoulders were up against the door pillar in the Audi. I've been able to fit into older versions of some of these cars without problems, but it seems like interiors are shrinking (I'm looking at you, Camry).

My daily driver at the moment is a 1998 F150, which fits okay - except I find myself having to peer under the tinted upper portion of the window because it sits at eye level for me.

"There's 2 kinds of errors:

* When you actually have a typo in your VIN and it is mathematically incorrect VIN and it doesn't even let you search.

* When you put the VIN in the tracker and it tried to find data for it and then no data is found. This is quite common and doesn't mean there's anything wrong with it. It is also a temporary issue, it may take a few weeks for it to show up, and it may even disappear again someday after that, rinse and repeat, the data isn't always there.

A cool trick is to download the Toyota app on your phone and add your VIN to your account, although you're not going to be able to check it's GPS location yet since you need to input an authorization code from the car's head unit, you will get door open notifications and eventually see tire pressure data.

"I‚Äôm gonna go against the grain here and just come from a financial angle:

If you switch, you are going to pay one-time transaction fees again (taxes, dealer fees, registration, loan origination fees, etc) that are 100% expense to you and will never be recouped. You‚Äôre also likely going to take a decent loss on the Camry, especially if you trade it in. 

DO NOT just look at monthly payments, this is how you overpay for things and make bad decisions. Figure out what this switch is actually costing you, what the total cost of either vehicle is with interest factored in, and how much you‚Äôll lose when trading the Camry in (what you paid and owe vs trade in value). 

If you‚Äôre okay with losing the one-time fee money (could be thousands in some states) and the loss from trading in the Camry, go for it. You might be able to get a lower interest rate with a Hyundai that helps make up for the cost of your losses. 

Keep in mind a hybrid Toyota is going to depreciate slower than a Hyundai, so you might consider waiting a few years before swapping since the price difference will be more in your favor. This will also allow you to spread out one-time costs more. There will also likely be a hybrid SC soon so make sure you won‚Äôt have FOMO again when that happens. 

I see no reason to rush into this decision, it‚Äôs 100% a want based on aesthetics and you should consider the true cost of switching and whether it‚Äôs worth it.",0.4779307,0.49157768,0.030491635

People need cars to get around. If you absolutely need one due to a car accident, or breakdown, etc. You might not want to get an old beat up used car that's just 25% cheaper than new. You'll take it on the chin with the price and interest.

"Likely for the same reason manufacturers can't punish dealers that sell under MSRP. 

Edited to add: laws were written after the manufacturers dumped cars onto dealers during a recession in the late 50's and early 60's. Agreements tended to favour the factory over the dealers. A lot of dealers were unable to service their floor plans (loans that pay for inventory while it waits for a customer to buy) because sales were so slow, and went under or faced very hard times. After that, dealers banded together to form lobbying groups to counter influence from factories. 

Smaller niche companies like Subaru have traditionally had closer ties with dealers than a huge company like Toyota. Even pre-pandemic, Subaru was known for constraining supply so that dealer lots were not flooded, and thus dealers didn't carry a lot of overhead and discounting was minimized. Also, Subaru knows they have to win over customers and fight for loyalty, while Toyota has no such concerns. People buy on reputation alone.",0.41800004,0.5601396,0.021860369

How long is the bounce? Couple days, staying a couple weeks?

In Ottawa, find a place that's off airport and does one way rentals. Hertz, Enterprise, the big nuts all do it. Off airport will get you better prices.

Get a fuel efficient econobox, a Toyota Corolla for instance. 6.2l/100km highway, NFI city but that's not your trouble so fuel from YQT to Ottawa airport is going to cost you $135 or so.

So, that Toyota is going to be $70-95 for a day, that's all you need to get here. The fuel is going to be $135. Whatever fees you tack on are your rodeo. You can do the burn in a days driving and if you feel you can't take turns. So let's add the fuck factor to it and add 10% to everything because mileage, bullshit, corn nuts, and such.

$270+$27FF, round trip fuel is about $300.

Your Adam Corolla rental, lucky and you get $140 for a round trip at $70, $81 or so with HST carry the common denominator and add the FF and let's say $90 each way for a total of $180, or if at $95 with all the math is like $240

"Hello! At that price range you can get a brand new Raize top variant (1L Turbo) which would be around 1.05m. 

However, from what I heard the more bang for your buck purchase is the G variant (1.2 NA).

I think Raize is a nice starting car considering it‚Äôs fuel efficient (even with your usual morning traffic I get about 9 km/l and I dont really have fuel efficient driving habits. If you‚Äôre driving during times with zero to little traffic I‚Äôve gotten as much as 26 km/l with it)

It also has a high ground clearance (around 200 mm). Not sure how comfy it is riding from the backseat as I‚Äôm rarely the passenger but it‚Äôs comfy enough on smooth asphalt (different story if you‚Äôre speeding past humps/potholes though).

Despite being a 3 cylinder, the engine is not as loud and doesn‚Äôt penetrate the cabin as much as you‚Äôd expect a normal 3 cylinder engine would so it has decent nvh. 

As for parts availability, considering it‚Äôs a toyota it‚Äôs very easy to find parts for them. Heck you can even get parts abroad if you wanna add mods to the car. It has a community too where people make project cars out of it.

Some extra things that might help you consider this car is that it‚Äôs very user friend and offer a lot of extra tech which make driving for beginners easier. It (Raize top variant) has blind spot monitoring which help you when you‚Äôre changing lanes. Front and rear parking sensors. Reverse camera with rear cross traffic alert.

"Their profits are regulated - which is why at the start of the pandemic when accidents went down, a lot of insurance companies had to refund money. There can still be things that cause changes.

I'm guessing you traded in for a different brand. Some brands have high theft rates. If you got a Hyundai/Kia, insurance companies might be really scared of theft. Some insurance companies are flat out refusing to insure many of their cars (https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/27/business/progressive-state-farm-hyundai-kia/index.html). Other brands like Honda and Toyota are often targets for their parts value so insurance might be higher. If you traded in something unattractive to thieves for something like a Honda CR-V (which I think is the most-stolen SUV), then your rates are going to go up. I'd also note that while cars might cost the same, their repair costs might be different. American brands are often a lot cheaper to repair than foreign brands. If you went from a Ford or Chevy to a Honda or Toyota, it's going to cost a lot more to repair if you have an accident and that's going to go into their decision.

It could also be that companies are reassessing the long-term replacement costs of vehicles. I think most companies thought that the car shortage was going to be a short-term thing, but it's looking like it's going to be around for several more years - especially since you're talking about a 2020 model-year vehicle. Replacing a 2020 vehicle is going to be expensive because output of new cars in 2020 was extremely low.

You can always get quotes from other companies and switch carriers. They are regulated, but companies do make different risk assessments. For what it's worth, my insurance rates went down 13.9% since the previous 6 month period, but I'm also driving a 2013 vehicle so it's probably something easy and cheap to replace for the insurance company. Replacing a 2019+ vehicle is going to be a much more expensive proposition, especially as we're still facing supply issues (and inflationary pressure).",0.38581148,0.58496517,0.029223362

"***Get a Corolla*** has already been beat into the ground by responders, but I'll back up what someone else said about the mechanic: Just take the water pump for starters: Was your BMW's engine temp gauge running hot, so you took it to the shop and the mechanic said, uh, yeah, the pump's impeller is shot therefore you're not getting enough coolant pumped to the engine and it'll overheat if you don't replace the pump and you'll blow the engine if that happens/you'll blow the head gasket!  Or did they just suggest, yeah, at such and such miles we recommend replaceing the water pump?!  Or, ""water pump's bad, need new water pump""?  If your engine was not overheating and was running more or less fine when you drove it in to the shop, it likely does Not need a new water pump. Water pump replacement just as one example is labor heavy... so the shop makes a decent markup on labor... but the water pump itself is relatively cheap. From my situation (with my 2012 Corolla, which is a great little car), my shop (my state requires annual inspection by a mechanic in order for drivers to renew their car's registration so the cops won't pull ya over, and property taxes) threw in valve gasket needs replacing.  I checked it out in the parking lot and was like, no it doesn't, just test the emissions and pass the vehicle, please.  Anyway- be more critical of what a mechanic is telling you. They have you as a captive audience anytime your car is in the shop, so sometimes they'll pile on suggested fixes that just aren't needed--- even for a high maint. Beemer. Once you get the Toyota or the Honda, be critical then, too.  Look up the part they're saying needs replaced, and its function in making the car run and think about it first.   Again, you'll be in a way better spot just getting a (even slightly marked up) Corolla or Civic. Someone please trademark ***Corolla or Civic*** as a post about reliable cars. Haha.

"Hey! I'll give some thoughts on the type of van you could get, but one of the most important parts of getting started is figuring out whether vanlife is actually right for you. Living in a van is a pretty unique lifestyle, and quite different from your single bedroom / roomate situation. You'll have a lot more flexibility, potentially save on costs, but there are some drawbacks and adjustments you may have to make to your routine. Before thinking about the type of van you might purchase: 

1) Research van life in general to make sure you're totally comfortable with the lifestyle. Keep in mind many instagrams, youtube channels etc. glamourize the lifestyle, so look for a variety of  resources that show the good and the bad, and different types of builds (fancy vs. budget). 

2)Take a test drive - if your situation allows this, meaning you don't need to leave your current living situation immediately, see if you can rent a van for a couple days to make sure it's your type of vibe.

3) Budget - while living in a van can save money, it does have a lot of extra costs you wouldn't normally have in an apartment (gas, insurance, conversion costs, maintenance, etc.) - these are going to differ for everyone so just make sure you're comfortable with your expectations.

4) Consider your life priorities &amp; goals - are you okay downsizing on material things? Inconveniencing your social life? Is the flexibility, cost saving and potential adventure your priority? Is this decision going to have any positive or negative experience on your college experience and studies?

5) connect with the van life community - you've already done this, but continue to get input form people on reddit, facebook, etc. to hear first-hand experience and advice. This type of question comes up a bit on these threads, so I've collected some of the best answers at the bottom of [this page](https://www.conversionsconsulting.com/post/is-vanlife-right-for-me) if it's helpful - but if you search on this forum, there are plenty of college students who have gone through a similar process.

It's important to be honest with yourself on this decision because once you get into purchasing and building out, it's a pretty serious process. Now onto your question about the type of van:

The right type of van is different for everyone, and depends on individual preferences, needs and budget. In your case, it sounds like budget and stealth may be important given your comment about rent, and living in a college area / campus. That said there are different styles of vehicles that may make sense looking into - campers/cargos/vans/conversion vans, traditional RVs, school buses, truck campers, SUVs or mini vans, box trucks, ambulances etc.

In the US, the Ford Transit, Mercedes Sprinter, Ram Promaster, Ford Econoline, Chevy Express, GMC Savana, Ford Transit Connect, Chrysler  Pacifica, and Toyota Sienna are some examples of popular vehicles, but you can really make it work with anything - this is a non exhaustive group just to give you a really introductory idea of what people might look for. 

Generally when deciding on a vehicle, you need to think about how you're going to use it; are you going to convert it yourself? Are you going to buy it previously built out? What features do you want in it - electrical, full water system (shower, sink, etc.), fridge, oven, etc? If you're in a college area, do you need this van to be stealthy? Or are you going to travel off-grid on the weekends? All of these types of questions will impact the type of vehicle that makes sense for you. Some of the basic factors you'll need to consider are size, fuel efficiency, mileage, maintenance, ability to customize and cost.

There are a ton of resources to look for vans for sale online - these will give you a sense of the types of builds people have done, and what's out there (inspiration) including r/vandwellermarketplace, facebook groups, thevancamper, vanlifetrader, vanviewer, conversiontrader, vanlifeadventure, RVT and more. As you might expect this question also gets asked a lot on this forum, so I've collected some of the useful threads at the bottom of [this page](https://www.conversionsconsulting.com/post/finding-a-van-for-sale).

"I mean I sat in both So speaking from experience here and admitted in my first comment that I would imagine the cabin is a little quieter in the Lexus, but I couldn't notice it driving them weeks apart from each other. Also said that the 23 had a redesign that now I can't say the same is true but looking at a 22 versus a 22 and I have the caramel leather that adds a little contrast I felt like the interior quality and design was nicer than the outgoing RX. 

Both were within my budget and I was looking at Volvo and Acura too, but the Highlander had enough going on in the Platinum trim and probably offered 90% of the comfort and luxury quality that Lexus offered that I couldn't justify getting the Lexus. Also there were some other points that I think the Highlander has over the Lexus as far as styling and interior space and just the layout overall. 

All of this is of course subjective and if you prefer the rx350 then go for it but I think a platinum Highlander blurs the line of entry level luxury pretty nicely. Go look at any YouTuber review or articles on the Platinum trim specifically, and you'll see that most people agree with me that if you're sitting in it and wouldn't have been told otherwise you'd second guess whether you were in a Lexus. So as far as I'm concerned the Highlander is the better buy and you can GTFO with your Toyota hate, but to each their own I guess.

"I would like to dissagree, what you said depends on many factors and models. For example, 2004-2010 honda accord with a k20 engine is really, and i mean REALLY reliable, lasting for over million of km without any big issues, only important thing is that you maintain it regularly.

Actually, one can argue that ANY car can last for more than million km if it is maintained well and driven well (i know a dude that went 2mil km with a 2004 audi A6 that was said to be a piece of crap and unreliable, but dude maintained it well), only problem is that when you buy a new car, you have nothing to worry about, but old cars went through at least one person, and you dont know if it was maintained well, so it can potentially result in some issues, but if you buy an old car from someone you know, and you know how it is maintained, and it has no issues, its almost like buying a new car.

So in essence, if we are talking about reliability, old vs new is a stupid debate because it doesnt account much of anything, and if we are talking about safety, there is no debate, new cars win. If we are talking about style, that is subjective, and you can argue about it. If we are talking about how easy it is to repair or maintain, it also depends on the car brand (boxer subaru is much harder to maintain that even a brand new bmw, and mazdas rotor is impossible to maintain), but mostly old cars are easier because they have less electronic parts and more primitive computers. That is why the old toyota pickup didnt die in top gear, it could be repaired with basic tools, while for a new bmw, just to change the battery you have to open the diagnostic and register it or it would possibly birn other electronics, litteraly every part of the car is monitored by a computer.",0.23254037,0.63646907,0.13099062

The Corolla Cross frankly just doesn‚Äôt make a whole lot of sense imo. a smaller cabin with vastly worse legroom than my 2016 civic (which comfortably fit two rear-facing car seats no problem), horrible fuel economy for the segment and an awful transmission feel (rubber band CVT). And lastly that nameplate‚Äî a new model made in a new factory under a new name- Mazda Toyota Manufacturing. Just way too many red flags for me.

"Yes, but the scope of the project is one of two things:

 ‚Äúlet‚Äôs use X, and build Y to learn about it‚Äù. This makes up the bulk of my unfinished project mountain. I don‚Äôt really care about Y, so not finishing the project is fine. 

This is usually a very different approach from when I want to *actually* solve a problem, which involves applying what I know as fast as possible. 

e.g My wife got injured during the winter, and had a hard time walking on ice and snow. I wrote a quick app that scanned the weather 10 minutes after my son‚Äôs bedtime, and told me the upcoming windows of precipitation with the highest % chance during that window, so I could prep/salt/shovel that night, or set an early alarm the next morning. 

Or when hunting for a car, I wrote a quick scraper against Toyota‚Äôs surprisingly public inventory API, which notified me hourly about changes in availability* in a radius I was willing to drive to. (there are whole websites dedicated to this, but none allowed me to search exactly the way I wanted). 

Both are examples of ridiculously small apps. The kind of work I can plan out on the back of a napkin at lunch, and then write up fast in over an evening or two.

"Why? The video that got most of us here has flying buses, magical raincloud generators, anthropomorphic autonomous robots, and pointless holographic dials on electrical equipment, and I can't imagine any of those are cheap. Solarpunk isn't primitive or cheap, it's egalitarian. Even if it costs $1000 per device and 10 people share one, that still only means it takes one year of the US military budget to supply the entire world with years of cooking that doesn't require any external power source.

Going by the sources of what other people posted here, it's at most $200 per device, or $20 per person, for free cooking for years. Compared to the cost of fuel in developing nations, that's *massive*, and it's hardly more expensive to get to people than a month's worth of food.

According to [this news article](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/special-reports/schools-demand-for-firewood-killing-the-environment-1632286), a small truck load of firewood costs about $80. According to google, 'small truck uganda' means vehicles like the Toyota Dyna, with a carrying capacity of 2000 kg. According to [this article](https://www.mdpi.com/2411-9660/4/4/46/htm), firewood consumption is about 2 kg per person per day, so firewood for cooking is about $0.08 per day. That means that a $20 pp solar oven pays itself back in under a year. Without using fossil fuels. Without requiring any sort of regular deliveries.

For less than 10% of the US military budget, we could build enough of these to replace fossil fuel and biomass cooking for over 30% of all meals on the planet, distribute them to people all over the world, and replace or repair them every 3 years, reducing global carbon emissions by more than 1%.

Honestly the fact that this vehicle has auto locks &amp; windows, AC and a screen are major upgrades for us. 
We really just wanted AWD and to be slightly higher up (and stay with Toyota). This has delivered for all those wants so we‚Äôre quite happy! We mostly do city driving but have taken it ‚Äúon the open road‚Äù once last summer and it was lovely. Have not had any mechanical issues yet. I live in a climate that sees A LOT of snow, sleet, slush &amp; ice and it‚Äôs felt so much better / safer than our Corollas. 

The only two complaints I have:
1. The USB is very sensitive and doesn‚Äôt always register (the Google maps screen just goes black when I start up the car another time sometimes). This is pretty minor, though. 
2. There isn‚Äôt enough room for a rear-facing car seat to be installed behind either front seat without having to roll the front seat up A LOT. This is kind of a big issue IMO and a possible dealbreaker for many (if they experienced this). Luckily, I‚Äôm not crazy tall so when my husband drives it‚Äôs not a big deal for me to ride in the front passenger seat rolled up. It‚Äôs not great for him though, but he can manage. My niece is slightly taller than my husband and she actually could not fit so we had no choice but to move our older kid‚Äôs booster seat in the trunk and she had to ride in the back seat. It‚Äôs funny because like I said we had two Corollas for years before this and had our oldest as a baby in those and we didn‚Äôt have the same issue as we do with the Cross. (But clearly when you go from a Corolla to a Cross, you‚Äôre transferring some of the space in the seating area for space in the trunk).

"Your best bets are going to be the Toyota Crown Platinum trim or Highlander AWD Platinum trim. The upcoming Grand Highlander in the top trim should also offer up close to match to Lexus. The current Tundra in Sequoia in their top trims are truck based body on frame so ride quality no matter how luxurious the cabins may feel can only be so good. Savage geese on YouTube said ride quality for the Sequoia left a lot to be desired actually especially for the price point 

I bought a 2022 Highlander Platinum AWD after test driving the 2022 Lexus RX 350L and felt like the interior of the Highlander I got was more luxurious than the Lexus. Lexus has since redesigned the RX 350 for 2023 I think more or less to widen the gap to get people more incentive to upgrade to the Lexus because 22. Versus 22 they're pretty neck and neck in many ways. Not the same for lower trim levels though

I would have had to test drive the RX 350 and the Highlander back to back or have a decibel reader to tell the difference between cabin noise. I'm sure the Lexus is a little quieter, but the Highlander is awfully quiet and has acoustic glass surrounding. Leather quality and heated/cooled seats feels nice and soft touch materials throughout the cabin are pretty plentiful and nicely done. Has a HUD, puddle lights, nice feeling leather steering wheel that's heated as well for some more luxurious feeling features 

The 22 has a V6 and it's buttery smooth. But the Highlander and the RX 350 changed to a turbo 4 for 23 and so a little less smooth and more noise but a little more torque and therefore acceleration. 

Toyota Crown has active dampening, but it's brand new and I haven't seen one in person yet. But in theory going by what's up on paper and some initial impression videos I've seen it should stack up fairly well to Lexus quality. Doesn't seem to be built for tall people though and roof line seems to be an issue if you're over 5'11- 6 ft. Also a drawback is it's probably going for higher than MSRP currently to where you're in the budget of a Lexus ES or RC anyways, so I'm not sure it would make sense to get the crown over a Lexus.",0.011288708,0.34325445,0.64545685

"I am a BMW owner but... Come on. No point in gatekeeping when non-owners also understand what's going on here. 

We all know Japanese cars are ""reliable."" What that actually means is that they can take a lot of abuse and neglect without falling apart. It also means there are lots of people who won't buy ""shitty"" old Fords because Found On Road Dead, but will buy shitty old Camrys because Toyotas are Reliable. And that drives the price up, because people are willing to pay a premium if they can expect not to face unforeseen costs. 

The BMWs you're thinking about are the opposite side of this coin. BMWs are cheap because they require expensive maintenance, perhaps preventatively, on parts that may not ever need replacing on a Camry. The cheaper the car gets, the less appealing that sounds on the prospective owner's budget - which means less demand, and lower prices. 

And so far I've been talking in broad stereotype, but if that 2007 3-Series is a 335i, it heat-soaked from the factory,  the high pressure fuel pump is a common point of failure, and you may need to replace things like the water pump and spark plugs as if they were wear items. If I wanted to track one of those, I'd want to spend ~$10K fixing the engine for it. Even if it's the (much more reliable) 328i, if the previous owner stuck to BMW's neglectful 15K oil-change intervals it's probably leaking in a few places right now. 

Not to say you can't have a good experience in a BMW or a bad experience in a Toyota - but you do need to wade through the muck to make sure that BMW is in good shape, and ultimately through fuel consumption and insurance your costs will be higher. My common recommendation at this budget is a reliable economy car from a brand that isn't Honda or Toyota which will offer more car for the money, but still have low costs - a Ford Fusion Hybrid, for example, which has a power train that's surviving 600k+ miles of taxi duty. Getting a good reliable car from BMW or another brand that's still reliable takes research, but that's what we're here for.

I, for one, paid $3350 for my super durable West German BMW... And spend money fixing it regardless because it's an old car, and all of them have cracked rubber.",0.52307713,0.428587,0.04833594

"South Africa would be a likely choice if it goes to Africa instead of Asia next (totally not biased).

Personally I don't want to see Japan for FH6 as the sheer hype that would generate would likely lead to massive disappointment and vitriol as it would reach a stage where no matter how good the game is it wouldn't meet the expectations imposed on it. I don't think it would be a Cyberpunk 2077 but looking at the current formula and development of FH5 I don't see them being able to even remotely pull off Japan successfully and in the manner people want.

Potentially for FH7 as the rate that technology is advancing now means that in 6 or so years time a game set in Japan has a significantly higher chance of being successful imo (provided the Horizon Formula also evolves to match).

For South Africa though there is significantly less on the line in terms of risk for product design and success, obviously people would be disappointed that it's not Japan but they'd likely be even more disappointed with the Japan we'd get in FH6.

In South Africa there is a lot of variation in the Climate with the Eastern Coast being fairly tropical, the Western Coast being somewhat Mediterranean with a tendency towards Arid the more north you go and the centre is a mixture of Temperate and Savannah environments.

Combined with the elevation of the Interior Plateau and potentially a small detour to the Drakensberg for some snow and I think it would be a good choice.

Lots of car culture too; Alfa, VW and Ford all have a very strong historical prescence and modern Toyota have a large prescence in terms of both Commercial and Motorsport divisions. In terms of Story Content the Game has the ability to explore the History of the Country and doesn't necessarily have to focus on Apartheid if the Devs deem it inappropriate, there's a lot of Cultural Groups native to the Country so there's multiple Indigenous Groups (both native African and descended from European Groups) to explore.

It also obviously has the Wildlife to match and exploring the Countryside could hold a lot of visual interest without even having human infrastructure present.

I'm not sure where exactly would be a good place to focus the map on though as there's so many different regions with vastly different experiences on offer.

Cape Town and the Western Cape would be the logical location given its attraction to foreign interest and a very good mix of areas even ignoring the East Coast and most of the Interior.

For the East Coast I don't see it being anywhere except Durban if it's set there, although the City isn't that nice it's better than Pietermaritzburg and has a decent amount of variation in the environment. There aren't really any large Arid Areas but there's portions of the Area which are situated on Iron-Rich Soil which gives the sand a Red Colour and that could be used for some environmental variation from the Greens/Browns of everywhere else and the Drakensberg Mountains are fairly close.

For the Centre of the Country Johannesburg would meet the City requirement as it's the most metropolitan area in the country and still retains some Open Areas around it.",0.20555006,0.6999848,0.09446513

"I've worked on Infiniti's advertising/marketing twice in my life, I shopped for a brand-new Q50 recently, and I also consider myself a car enthusiast. This is what I know. 

The luxury/premium market is a picky one. Heritage means a lot, and as a result, new luxury/premium brands have a tough time establishing themselves. It's also a very competitive side of the market, where brands are constantly iterating their products. If you look at the major premium brands (Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Lexus), most of their products receiving constant updates, if not complete overhauls. This requires a lot of investment in new product, design, and technology. 

Infiniti was always facing an uphill battle when it was introduced in the late '80s, early '90s. Lexus and Acura are good parallels because they both launched at similar times, and were also ""challenger"" brands from Japan. Lexus is the stand-out here. Toyota committed large amounts of resources to making the brand a success, and was willing to play the long game to establish themselves. Their early products weren't merely good, but they were class-leading, with prices that often undercut the established competition by thousands of dollars. They also fully intended to be a global brand, and launched around the world, which helped establish credibility and helped brand awareness. Genesis is following a similar trajectory if you look at where they've gone from the introduction of the first sedan to now. 

In contrast, Infiniti mainly started out with rebadged Nissans, that weren't quite as good as their competition. Nissan's financial health meant their commitment to the brand wavered over the years. They've been present in few markets (initially just the US and the Middle East, if I recall correctly). There was an eventual kick in the ass, and Infiniti belted out a series of winning product over a series of years, but this was wasn't until the 2000s, when the brand had been on the market pushing mediocre product for a decade. This was short-lived however, and commitment to the brand wavered again. Products were left on the market too long without significant updates, and were left behind by the competition. The Q50 was a good car when it launched, and it's still a good car in isolation, but it's been left behind by most of the competition at this stage in most key categories. Infiniti dealers in the Middle East will tell you (unofficially) the biggest problem they have isn't selling the cars, but retaining customers. Someone will buy a Q50. They'll come back three years later to trade-in/upgrade, and they still have the same line-up on sale, while the competition has all-new cars. 

They also never launched in Japan, are available in few Asian markets, and were in Europe from 2008 to 2020. A lot of people around the world, just don't know what these things are. My father-in-law came to visit me last year, and thought it was a new Chinese brand or something. So lack of credibility and awareness are a thing. 

Where does that Infiniti now? It feels like a premium value brand now (if that makes any sense). The only thing they've really got going for them (and this will vary from market to market) is a great dealership experience (they invest heavily in this) and bang for your buck. I shopped entry-level premium sedans last year. $40,000 would've gotten me into a base Q50 with a twin-turbo V6 (that engine is still glorious) and RWD. The cheapest A-Class Mercedes would sell me was nearly $55,000. Which is a smaller, significantly less powerful FWD car, that I would've had to wait till April to get.

"They've changed the manner of death. Are you suggesting that was willy-nilly? In order to come to that determination they'd have to have some new evidence. And they supposedly found some according to Bland. So obviously they think they know what happened to Stephen if they're so confident it wasn't an accident. If that new evidence convinced them to change the manner to homicide then it could have easily convinced them to change the cause of death if they thought it should be changed. How could they know it's not an accident but not know what happened? 

And again, they did investigate it. In fact SLED was there in the beginning and they didn't see it as anything other than a hit and run immediately either. High way patrol had a warrant for Stephen's phone. They had his iPad. They had the paint chips that match Toyota paint. They conducted a ton of interviews asking people if Buster was gay with Stephen. They had other leads that were barely touched on because they seemed very focused on chasing down the Buster rumor. They had the rape kit that they supposedly lost. They had DNA swabs and fingernail clippings. They had all of the same information that SLED has now except they didn't have access to whatever SLED found when they were investigating Murdaugh, which if it was digital like Bland heavily implied, then they wouldn't have ever had access to that anyway. Obviously they were trying to track down who killed Stephen just the same as any other investigative body would do. They have all of the things that SLED could have collected.

You're right that highway patrol doesn't investigate murders but they do have a criminal unit and are perfectly capable of investigating vehicular homicides. Based on the blood and brains at the scene Stephen was struck in the head right there in the middle of the road with immense force. There's nothing that suggested he was beaten to death. MAIT made no mention of it in their reports. The only other suggestion was that it was a gunshot wound which it turned out not to be. There was just nothing that could point to a murder or anything unrelated to some sort of MVC. So the investigation stalled not because they couldn't investigate but because they didn't have any evidence or information available to them. Information that SLED only came upon by chance while investigating a different murder. 

Ultimately it sounds like high way patrol was confused about what they saw because they're used to seeing debris in the road and they probably don't usually see bodies directly in the middle of the road (I've speculated that maybe someone was chasing him or otherwise fucking with him and he tried to run across the street and got hit). They suggested to SLED to the coroner and the pathologist that they thought it was a gunshot wound, that was the only alternative they suggested and it was wrong. So the next logical step is to go with the conclusion of the expert who determined it wasn't a gun shot wound. It sounds like they don't understand what manner of death even is based on detective Proctor suggesting that the manner of death should be ""motor vehicle crash"" when that's clearly not how these things are done. I think if the pathologist got an attitude it was because people who didn't do the autopsy and don't know anything about autopsies tried to tell her that the obvious blunt force trauma that she saw was probably a gunshot wound, called her boss and told him that they thought it was a gunshot wound, and then the next guy comes along and suggests that she list ""car crash""  as manner of death when that's never been a manner of death. I'd have been frustrated too.",0.34522933,0.6308336,0.023937052

"You would have to have access to every state‚Äôs vehicle registrations. Then you‚Äôd have to assume they were registered properly.

When you import a JDM vehicle they are registered or given a VIN. In Japan they do engine and chassis codes, but don‚Äôt have VINs like US cars have. So when you go to register it you have to get someone who knows the process to get that in the system. Import companies do this for you.

But once you have the VIN it still won‚Äôt show up in places like CARFAX, dealership service systems, or on parts sites. 

All this to say I doubt there is any way to know for sure. A site like VINwiki is only as good as the records it pulls from. My car is registered and titled, but the VIN doesn‚Äôt work in any system you try to enter it into. For service at a Toyota dealership they had to get support to override the ‚Äúnot a valid VIN‚Äù entry. CARFAX won‚Äôt let you enter the VIN because it‚Äôs too short. KBB says it‚Äôs invalid.

Looked at a CX-5 turbo used that had been on the lot for 80 days and they‚Äôre asking about 4k less than what it was new. They will not budge on their asking price at all. This is a cpo unit, a 2021 with less than 20k miles. Found similar ones for approximately $1500 less although it would be an 8 hour drive.

They are pretty reliable(comparable to Toyota and Honda actually), many go 200,000 miles with regular maintenance.

"Toyota and Honda both had waitlists. You couldn't buy them new, so a 2017 Toyota Camry with 70K miles was selling for around 2K under MSRP with worse financing rates (e.g., $24K for a $26K MSRP base Camry). So at the end of the loan you're paying $1K+ *more* overall for a car that already has 70K miles on it.

Look, I know you're used to the wisdom that buying a new car is financially terrible, and I felt the same way. However, there were many, many reddit threads about this and countless other articles. The used car market was busted, and if this is the first you're hearing about it then congratulations for not having to buy a car during probably the worst time to do that ever.

Also, I know brand new cars depreciate. It was in the calculations, weighed *against* the new car, and still it made more sense to buy new. This was not a decision I made lightly.

"I really do think it's the combination of Nissan not innovating at all the last 10 years and the stigma you mention. 

The G35, G37, and even the Red Sport are proper luxury performance cars of their era. But for the current models of the last decade or so, the interiors and tech are behind the competition.  Just look at the infotainment in those cars, and the materials too. It's just been left behind and Nissan/Infiniti doesn't care.

The reviewers and buyers who read those reviews also really buy into the stigma of reckless driving and they don't want that. Most people buy a car for the image that car brings them as much as anything else. Owning a low trim BMW, Lexus, or Acura has much more clout in the office parking lot. Everyone they know will think they must have money and are doing well. No one knows the Infiniti name. It doesn't mean anything to the general person. I have a flashy red G37s with the 19in Enkei wheels and red calipers. My coworkers all ask me about it because it's red and looks sporty among their bland colored kias and toyotas.

I love my G37s and I think it's the best value performance for the money. It's such a fun car on a curvy backroad. But I'm also a Nissan guy and own many Nissan sports cars.

"I have plenty of experience in these military vehicles.

They can be fixed but will more than likely break after a few hundred miles, the AC won‚Äôt work, hoses burst all the time especially the coolant one, I‚Äôve had one randomly catch fire from the batteries under the passenger seat, they easily rollover, transmissions get destroyed constantly, they chug fuel especially the armored ones, and they‚Äôll wobble after you reach 55 MPH if you can even get it to get that high and it isn‚Äôt stuck at 30 MPH. 

These were all problems stateside with good roads, short trips, and weather that wasn‚Äôt too hot constantly.

"Advice is based on what is reasonable and what you can get out of the vehicle and the packages for Toyota is trying to sell its customers. Not to mention its also about the inherent practicalities and driving it, a car is a day to day tool for most people and you can't just simply be looking at any car. You have to find a car you will enjoy being in it everyday.

For similar value, Subaru offers more in terms of driving practicality a better AWD system thats already built into it than what Toyota is selling, especially when OP is on a budget. You want to maximum value.

Toyota Cross is mediocre in terms of value proposition amongst its competitors. Toyota only reason for having this vehicle is merely because everyone else has a good selling CUV but Toyota doesn't. They haven't put much thought into designing a vehicle that is for CUV market where else every other manufacturer either created a model ground up or significantly adapted and rebuilt the car designed for this market.

yes CHR and HRV is garbage mainly because the engine is anemic as hell and small like Mazda CX3......Toyota cross is no different in that regards. Yes it has a decent size hatcback space but everything else is meh, even the top trim AWD is meh. There just nothing in a Toyota Cross that screams special or value worth.

At least the Mazda CX30 while still small has looks, and interior finishing with decent engine and transmission, while the Subaru has practicality. Toyota Cross has neither.

Yes I have a 2005 Toyota Scion tC with 171K miles and original owner of the car from day 1.. Only things that I have done wit it was full synthetic oil changes every 5000 miles.. Coolant flushes, transmission fluid changes,  power steering fluid changes... PCV valve....Spark plugs, serpentine belt. tires, brakes and rotors. In terms of issues... only issue I have had is .. crappy sun visors design that broke at the hinge (a well known issue)... rear hatch garnish breaking off.... (Toyota considers it a garnish and not a handle is BS;but after 6-7 years with enough scion tc, xb,and Prius owners complained of crappy design they gave only a 1 year extended warranty period for replacement..  My Speed odometer console needs to be resolver since I fixed it temporary for 10 years when it broke during the first 7 years...  Need a do a better job in desoldering now.  My car is over 18 years old now and I will be replacing my motor mounts soon after I redo the coolant system ...such as replacing plastic radiator, hoses, water pump, tension clamps and thermostat since I don't want to overheat my car and end up damaging a good engine .... overheats will damage the headgasket of the engine.. also will need to replace sunroof weather seal and window weather seal and another weather seal at the front windshield.  Need to replace my valve cover gasket. Overall car has been great..

I have a 2014 Subaru Outback with 125K miles yeah seems my Outback eats some parts. Replaced my front control arms since rear bushing went bad. Replaced my Front CV Axles since while replacing the front control Arms I accidentally nicked one of my CV Boots. Replaced my rear wheel bearing assembly... Replaced my starter since it was making a grinding noise since it seems the grease was gelling up(did not happen til last winter and sound disappeared during the summer and came back this winter... decided to replace starter since it would be faster than taking apart the original starter and cleaning and re-greasing it. Replaced serpentine belt and idlers and tensioner since it was making noise.  My HVAC air blender actuator is going bad and making clicking sounds sometimes. Will replace that later but requires to pull the entire dashboard out.  Need to replace my Valve cover gaskets and spark plug seals.

Over all  subaru design is easier in replacing water pump, belt and other things..  

Over all driving the Outback in snow is great... My brother has a Honda CRV  and definitely the outback does better in snow....

" O ministro dos Transportes, Renan Filho (MDB-AL), aguarda ansiosamente a aprova√ß√£o da nova √¢ncora fiscal para decidir os rumos dos projetos de sua pasta.

 Com a nova regra, ele espera ampliar o or√ßamento de quase R$ 22 bilh√µes em 2023 ‚Äîmais do que o executado em toda a gest√£o de seu antecessor, o atual governador de S√£o Paulo Tarc√≠sio de Freitas (Republicanos).

 Na mesa est√£o obras como ferrovias, um pacote de rodovias e a modelagem de parcerias p√∫blico-privadas.

 Renan Filho rejeita o uso de dinheiro p√∫blico no projeto do trem-bala entre Rio e S√£o Paulo. ""A chance de que n√£o d√™ certo √© grande"", disse.

 **Sua meta √© priorizar ferrovias. O minist√©rio vai gastar em grandes obras? **A Fico [Ferrovia de Integra√ß√£o do Centro-Oeste] e a Fiol [Ferrovia de Integra√ß√£o Oeste-Leste] s√£o obras estruturantes do Plano Nacional de Log√≠stica. Concedemos o primeiro trecho da Fiol, o segundo [Fiol 2] est√° em obra e achamos que fica de p√© [a concess√£o]. Daria, ent√£o, para fazer Fiol 3 [com os recursos obtidos com a concess√£o do segundo trecho]. A Fico √© uma obra em investimento cruzado com a Vale [a empresa faz a obra como contrapartida pela renova√ß√£o antecipada de seu contrato].

  **O trem-bala √© um projeto privado, mas analistas avaliam que n√£o vai parar em p√© sem dinheiro p√∫blico. O governo pode entrar como ****s√≥cio?** Seria bom para o Brasil ter um trem-bala que liga o Rio a S√£o Paulo de maneira r√°pida e barata. A chance de que n√£o d√™ certo √© grande, mas eu tor√ßo para que d√™ certo. S√≥ que √© uma obra que custa R$ 50 bilh√µes. O Brasil investiu R$ 5 bilh√µes ano passado em todo o setor.

 **Ent√£o, o governo n√£o entrar√° nesse projeto?** O governo n√£o tem como decidir por uma despesa desse tamanho.

 **O sr. sempre fez muitas cr√≠ticas ao teto de gastos. A nova √¢ncora n√£o trar√° limite para sua pasta? **Critiquei o teto de gastos porque, na verdade, ele virou um teto de investimento, transformando o Brasil, que √© uma das maiores economias do mundo, no pa√≠s que menos investe. Al√©m de tratar despesa e investimento como gasto, sem qualific√°-los, ele foi descumprido todos os anos. Foi mais estourado do que pneu de Toyota Bandeirante, como a gente diz l√° no Nordeste. Diante disso, foi um erro [investir t√£o pouco]. Aqui no minist√©rio, investiram R$ 20 bilh√µes nos √∫ltimos quatro anos. Somente neste ano vamos investir mais [que todo esse per√≠odo]. Ser√£o R$ 21,7 bilh√µes.

 **A nova √¢ncora fiscal deve atrelar despesas e investimentos ao crescimento do PIB. As regras podem comprometer o andamento dos projetos de sua pasta? **N√£o conhe√ßo os dispositivos que ser√£o disparados e quais os par√¢metros utilizados [para defini√ß√£o de gastos e investimentos], mas essa din√¢mica antic√≠clica √© inteligente. Investir mais no momento em que o Brasil cresce menos ajuda o pa√≠s a se recuperar. E quando a economia estiver crescendo mais, a gente pode manter o investimento anterior ou diminuir, porque outros segmentos da economia compensar√£o.

 **E se n√£o houver acordo no Congresso para a aprova√ß√£o da nova √¢ncora fiscal? **Vamos investir quatro vezes mais que o governo anterior. Agora, isso n√£o pode virar um voo de galinha. O que precisamos do novo arcabou√ßo √© a defini√ß√£o de um patamar ‚Äîque seja o deste ano ou um pouco inferior‚Äî para que a gente mantenha os investimentos. √â assim que o cidad√£o faz em sua casa. A dona de casa pede aos filhos para desligar o ventilador quando for dormir, apagar a luz, economizar √°gua, para [a fam√≠lia poder] comprar um saco de cimento e tijolos para construir um quarto maior para a filha, aumentar a cozinha ou fazer uma garagem. Esse mesmo racioc√≠nio tem de ser usado pelo pa√≠s. √Äs vezes, na √¢nsia de segurar a despesa do governo, tudo √© qualificado da mesma maneira e √© um erro.

 **O senhor defende mais gasto?** A √çndia investir√° US$ 33 bilh√µes. A Uni√£o Europeia investir√° 30 bilh√µes de euros na infraestrutura da Espanha para melhorar o turismo. Em 2022, o Uruguai investiu R$ 5 bilh√µes [em infraestrutura]. O presidente Lula foi ao Uruguai e [o presidente daquele pa√≠s] Lacalle Pou pediu que o Brasil fizesse uma [outra] ponte que interliga o pa√≠s. A√≠ eu falei para o presidente que, na verdade, a gente √© que deveria pedir a ponte para o Uruguai. [Ent√£o] N√£o estou defendendo gastar mais, mas criar um modelo que preserve a sustentabilidade sem desqualificar despesas.

 **O governo ainda n√£o tem base s√≥lida para aprovar a √¢ncora fiscal. O que falta para chegar l√°? **Falta finalizar a proposta em si. O Congresso inteiro defende o arcabou√ßo. At√© a oposi√ß√£o. O presidente precisa mostrar base e essa quest√£o n√£o vai estressar. A reforma tribut√°ria, talvez.

 **Conduzir√° programa de concess√£o ou o foco ser√° somente obra p√∫blica? **Vamos seguir nas concess√µes, autoriza√ß√µes nas ferrovias, e o governo quer atuar tamb√©m em PPPs [parcerias p√∫blico-privadas]. Precisa ampliar isso para atra√ß√£o de capital privado. Uma obra de R$ 10 milh√µes pode ser vi√°vel se o governo colocar R$ 3 milh√µes e o privado, R$ 7 milh√µes. Isso vale para obra grande e pequena. Vamos imaginar que o novo arcabou√ßo permita que a gente mantenha o or√ßamento deste ano ou o pr√≥ximo e o governo tenha em quatro anos R$ 100 bilh√µes de investimento. Podemos pegar R$ 15 bilh√µes desse total e alavancar outros R$ 50 bilh√µes com PPPs.

 **Mas por que at√© hoje as PPPs s√≥ avan√ßaram nos estados? **Porque o privado n√£o acredita que o p√∫blico coloque o dinheiro. Porque no passado n√£o colocou. A gente tem de criar um modelo cr√≠vel.

 **As PPPs ent√£o n√£o substituir√£o as concess√µes? **N√£o. Ser√£o [feitas] para os contratos sem viabilidade de serem concedidos 100% pelo poder p√∫blico.

 **O retrocesso na privatiza√ß√£o do porto de Santos afetar√° a capacidade de transporte das ferrovias? **No porto de Santos n√£o teve retrocesso. O governo est√° dando uma olhada em qual √© o melhor modelo. Um exemplo: todo o suco de laranja exportado pelo Brasil hoje sai pelo porto de Santos. E se o porto [privatizado] n√£o quiser mais exportar suco? Nosso produto pode ficar mais caro [saindo por outro porto]. O porto funciona bem. A dificuldade √© chegar em Santos.

 **Os concession√°rias ferrovi√°rios falam em desequil√≠brio contratual se a amplia√ß√£o da capacidade de escoamento do porto via privatiza√ß√£o n√£o sair. **Eles estavam mais interessados no porto de Santos do que nas ferrovias deles. Essa √© a grande verdade. O porto de Santos √© a cereja do bolo.

 **O senhor quer dizer que eles queriam comprar o porto?** Certamente. Todos os concession√°rios s√£o muito fortes e os principais agentes [interessados]. Por isso, defendem a conex√£o das duas coisas. Ningu√©m quer decidir o caminho. N√£o tem sentido come√ßar a fazer o que o outro [governo] vinha fazendo. Ora, ele perdeu a elei√ß√£o.

 **Como o senhor pretende atrair a iniciativa privada diante um cen√°rio de infla√ß√£o e juros em quase 14%? **Aprovando o arcabou√ßo fiscal que permita a redu√ß√£o da taxa b√°sica de juros no Brasil.

 **S√≥ isso reduz a taxa?** Vai ajudar.

 **O presidente Lula d√° sinais de que o presidente do BC boicota o governo segurando os juros em patamares elevados. O senhor concorda? **A infla√ß√£o est√° abaixo da m√©dia internacional e a taxa de juros, muito acima. Se aprovar a √¢ncora, o BC n√£o ter√° mais argumento. Se baixar de 13,75% para 9,75% j√° reduz o pagamento de juros [da d√≠vida p√∫blica] em R$ 100 bilh√µes.

 **O senhor avalia que h√° atua√ß√£o pol√≠tica do presidente do BC?** Acho que o presidente do BC, por mais corajoso que seja, n√£o faria isso. Mas se o Brasil aprovar esse arcabou√ßo e as expectativas forem ancoradas, os juros n√£o ca√≠rem n√£o far√£o mais sentido.

 **Uma emenda constitucional imp√¥s √† Uni√£o aceitar pagamento de concess√µes por meio de precat√≥rios. A AGU, na pr√°tica, suspendeu. O que o senhor pensa disso?** Tem que aprovar o arcabou√ßo porque, da mesma forma que n√£o se pode obrigar o governo a gastar mais por decreto, tamb√©m n√£o pode obrig√°-lo a arrecadar menos.

 **Mas √© constitucional**. O governo acabou de assumir e n√£o tem regulamenta√ß√£o. No Brasil, infelizmente, aprovaram uma lei para n√£o se pagar precat√≥rio no governo passado. Ela diz o seguinte: o governo tem um precat√≥rio de R$ 100 e vai pagar respeitando uma fila. Um sujeito com o precat√≥rio de R$ 100 topa vend√™-lo para um concession√°rio por R$ 30 desde que receba hoje. Paga R$ 30 e usa um t√≠tulo de R$ 100 para quitar uma outorga. Isso significa reduzir receita para o governo. Do mesmo jeito que o governo n√£o pode aumentar a receita indiscriminadamente, n√£o se pode reduzir a arrecada√ß√£o. Causa inseguran√ßa fiscal para o pa√≠s. O mesmo privado que cobra sustentabilidade, quando √© o caso espec√≠fico dele, quer pagar menos por uma outorga. Eu acho que n√£o deveria poder. Mas isso √© lei e j√° foi judicializada. √â plaus√≠vel que o STF reconhe√ßa a Constitui√ß√£o e que o governo estabele√ßa um caminho para se pagar a outorga [com os precat√≥rios].

 **O senhor j√° teve um embate pol√≠tico com a presidente do PT envolvendo a modelagem das concess√µes das rodovias do Paran√°. Como est√° lidando com a inger√™ncia do PT?** N√£o tive embate com a presidente do PT. Ela atua nesse projeto como deputada do Paran√°. Ela tem uma preocupa√ß√£o porque o estado pagava o mais caro ped√°gio do Brasil. Estabeleceram-se obras no contrato que n√£o foram feitas. Ela s√≥ fez uma ressalva: que o modelo [de concess√£o] garanta que as obras sejam feitas, porque o estado cresce muito, com o menor ped√°gio poss√≠vel. Ali√°s, √© a mesma coisa que o governador, eu, a Casa Civil e o presidente Lula querem. N√≥s estamos conversando sobre o modelo, que est√° na fase final.

"If you can get a low interest rate it‚Äôs absolutely worth it to finance something and get out from under the money pit. You‚Äôre dumping money into an old vehicle when you could finance something reliable and start investing your money instead. 

I‚Äôm guessing you paid out of pocket for your previous car. But if you‚Äôve got an interest rate under 6% many people make more money financing and investing their money elsewhere than paying cash. Just make sure the car has positive equity so you‚Äôre never stuck driving something you don‚Äôt end up wanting or liking. 

The other thing- it sounds like you want a reliable car. Pay attention to consumer reports and also make sure you know the average cost of maintenance. The cars you listed aren‚Äôt bad but they don‚Äôt necessarily sound like what you‚Äôre searching for. And if you‚Äôre willing to pay that much for them, I think it‚Äôs worth it to get into a brand you know is going to do all things you want. You already know a Toyota can go for 300k miles and have super low maintenance cost, but a Buick? Did you check it‚Äôs upcoming maintenance schedule? What about when it starts hitting high mileage? 

Depending on the year you‚Äôre looking the price of a Toyota will be 20k give or take with relatively low miles. New is probably 25k, but remember as soon as you become the 1st owner and drive it off the lot, it immediately loses thousands of dollars in value so I generally buy used with low miles and in great condition instead. 

The reason people promote Honda/Toyota/Lexus/Mazda is because 1) the cost of ownership is low, 2) they last forever, and 3) since they last forever, they hold their value well. 

Personal opinion- go get you a Toyota Camry or a Honda Civic, ect. You can buy the performance car of your dreams later. First you gotta have something reliable. Don‚Äôt waste your time on vehicles that ‚Äúsound good‚Äù go for the award winning brands you KNOW will get you what you want.

I‚Äôve purchased two Honda‚Äôs in the past 5 or so years, and both times I‚Äôve used pricing online from a particular Honda dealer that sells Honda Care at a very marginal markup to negotiate similar pricing from my local dealership (roughly $800 for 80k/5yr additional coverage, $0 deductible).

I can‚Äôt seem to find a similar thing for any other brands though. Is this a practice exclusive to Honda Care? I‚Äôve always thought for a cost as low as this, it‚Äôs been worth it and has paid off on both Accords I‚Äôve owned. But when my wife purchased a RAV4 Hybrid, I couldn‚Äôt find other Toyota dealers online selling Toyota extended warranty separately, and our local dealer of course was quoting nearly $3k for a similar coverage to the Honda Care mentioned above.

"Eka auto oli 1992 Toyota Carina II 1.6 XLi, jonka sain ukilta kun t√§ytin 18. Se oli oikein hyv√§ j a luotettava peli ja kohtasi loppunsa ennen kuin sit√§ edes ajettiin kunnolla sis√§√§n. Alle 300 tkm mittarissa narkkarin pist√§ess√§ sis√§tilat paskaksi johtoja etsiess√§√§n. Valitettavasti silloinen rahatilanne ei ollut hyv√§ ja mik√§ tahansa korjaus ylitti auton arvon, joten se siit√§. Harmi, sill√§ vaikka se oli vain 1.6, se tuntui aika reippaalta. Alav√§√§nt√∂ oli yll√§tt√§v√§n hyv√§ bensakoneelle. Ja koska simppeli Toyota, se oli halpa ja helppo huoltaa, eik√§ siihen vuosien omistamisen aikana vaihdettu mit√§√§n muuta, kuin kuluvia osia. K√§sitt√§√§kseni ukkikaan ei paljoa muuta vaihtanut (todisteena vihot, joissa merkattu *jokainen* tankkaus, pyyhkij√§n sulkien vaihto, huolto, kaikki uudesta siihen asti, ett√§ auto tuli minulle).

Sen j√§lkeen olin vuosia ilman autoa, mutta pari vuotta sitten rahatilanne salli auton hankinnan ja se vapauden tunne siit√§, ett√§ voi l√§hte√§ minne vaan ilman suunnittelua julkisten mukaan oli itselle iso juttu. Katselin ensin 2.0 VW Golffeja nelivedolla, koska omat kokemukset Golfista olivat tosi hyvi√§, mutta 1.4 (TSI?) ja 1.6 TDI olivat hiukan liian laiskoja omaan makuunz enk√§ halunnut etuvetoa. 

Sitten tein ison virheen, josta k√§rsin ja nautin t√§n√§kin p√§iv√§n√§. Otin sielt√§ hakuehdoista sen nelivedon pois ja laitoin takavedon tilalle. Tajusin heti ett√§ se oli virhe, jota tulee seuraamaan toinen ihan perkeleen iso virhe: Golfin hinnalla* saa jotain paljon kivempaa. Se toinen virhe seurasi kaksi viikkoa my√∂hemmin, kun l√∂ytyi yksil√∂ sopivilla spekseill√§. Viikko t√§st√§ eteenp√§in k√§vin hakemassa etsitty√§ ripe√§mm√§n peli pihaan.

Ihan viimeist√§√§n t√§ss√§ vaiheessa jokainen tajuaa, ett√§ t√§ss√§ ei ole oikeastaan j√§rjen kanssa ~~paljoa~~ yht√§√§n mit√§√§n tekemist√§.

Se oikeasti j√§rkevin moottori minulle olisi jokin, jolla auto kiihtyy hiukan muuta liikennett√§ paremmin, koska se takaa turvallisena liittymisen moottoriteille. Mahdollisimman v√§h√§kulutuksinen, sek√§ sellainen, ett√§ se ei pist√§ vituttamaan. Kolmesylinterisen moottorin v√§rin√§ tuntuu hirve√§lt√§, eli luultavasti minulle j√§rkevin olisi joku turbo-I4, mahdollisesti hybridi.

"It really doesn‚Äôt matter to me. I own a GM badged Toyota at the moment, looking at a 6MT Passat wagon in the near future. 

It really just depends on what peaks my interest at the moment I‚Äôm looking for my next car.

"So, a couple things. 


Modern cars are driven by discrete modules (computers) that various automotive suppliers manufacture, that are generally limited in their scope and designed to integrate into multiple car manufacturers systems across many platforms of vehicle. 

My Acura has 48 of these computers that all connect together via canbus to stay in synch and do their jobs. 

Tesla was not given access to this standard parts bin from the tier 1 automotive suppliers because the major manufacturers refused to give them access to their shared parts or to do no business with tesla at all. 

So what‚Äôs a startup automobile manufacturer gotta do when they have been cut off from all the tier 1 suppliers. They go to tier 2 or 3 suppliers and/or build their own. They connect with companies the major automotive manufacturers didn‚Äôt use as much. They went to tech companies for their inspiration and all that technology they had to create from scratch. 

As a result they have a single pc board and use automotive Ethernet to send out the signals. This allows for a massive weight reduction in the wiring harness because your sending data and not switched power. It also allows the single board to control and manage every system in real time versus canbus extremely limited bandwidth and only the required data being sent. 

I bought an extended warranty because my car has every option acura offered in 2018. There is a ton of these computers all over my car. The computers are older technology that is extremely durable and rarely fail. But when they do, it‚Äôs expensive. 

Warranties are a personal preference if you want to reduce risk and can afford it. I buy them sometimes after much research and so far I have came out ahead. But I don‚Äôt buy them blindly and I negotiate the price heavily.

My 2018 motor blew and cost $6k for replacement. Totally covered by warranty I paid $2,250 for.

"Okay, so, manage your expectations. Reliability on virtually any modern car won‚Äôt be an issue ‚Äî deferred maintenance is what will get you. 

If I recall, that V6 was derivative of the V8, just with two extra cylinders lopped off. That V8 is a supercar engine, currently making 575 bhp in supercharged form. No matter how you slice it, the V6 or V8 will require maintenance that likely the Avalon won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know enough about the engines in the ES, but I‚Äôm willing to bet they are less maintenance. 

But you can‚Äôt really compare a Toyota product to a Jaguar. This isn‚Äôt to suggest that they are bad, but just geared to different sectors and people. Toyota is as mainstream as it gets, and this translates into its cars ‚Äî they‚Äôre a little bit like IKEA furniture.  Well designed, well built, but a bit‚Ä¶bland. Jaguars, by contrast, are more like custom pieces made by a reputable carpenter ‚Äî they cost more, but are far more interesting. 

If you damage or need to repair a piece of IKEA furniture, you either throw the whole piece out, or repair quickly and cheaply. Damaging a custom piece will cost more to fix generally. But the ownership experience is far different. 

There‚Äôs a certain joy you get when you hear that engine rev. Then the tingles of excitement when you drive the car, somehow bridging that gap between driving engagement that BMWs and Porsches are known for, but offering that supple comfort that Mercedes or Rolls Royce are known for. Jaguar almost always nails their drive/comfort compromise in a way that‚Äôs nearly impossible to match. 

Then there‚Äôs the looks - sure tastes are subjective but anyone with functioning brain cells and vision can tell which is the prettier car. And that‚Äôs before we come to the interior ‚Äî oh the elegance. The XF of that era just felt special. Even the new ones feel more special somehow then most other cars in the segment. Sure you‚Äôll find odd switch gear here and there, and the infotainment is probably something you‚Äôll want to upgrade, but man, for a bit of occasion, Jags take a beating. 

So really, what you‚Äôre wanting to know is cost of ownership, which can be hard to pinpoint. But let‚Äôs assume the Jag has decent service records, and has been appropriately maintained throughout its life. In that context, it won‚Äôt be a ruinous endeavour but it‚Äôll cost. 

Put it this way - if you‚Äôre used to the following:  

* large pickup trucks/SUVs - F-150s, 4Runners, Range Rovers, etc. 
* small pickup trucks ‚Äî Ranger, Colorado, etc. 
* executive saloons/crossovers ‚Äî Porsche, Maserati, Mercedes, BMW, Audi etc. 
* muscle cars - Mustang, Camaro, etc. 

You can afford a Jag. In fact, my Jag consistently costs less to run overall then nearly any other car in my family.  

However, if you‚Äôre used to compact, economy, or very economical cars, such as but not limited to: 

* Toyota Yaris 
* Ford Focus
* Toyota Corolla 
* Honda Civic 
* Hyundai Elantra 

Then yes, a Jaguar will be a whole new world for you, and it can be scary. Do what you will. 

If it were me, I‚Äôd get an inspection by independent qualified individual, and only proceed with his thumbs up plus a good service history. The parts on those Jags, from the engine, to the gearbox, the switch gear to the body panels are all pretty solid generally speaking. Tried and true. The weakness is bad maintenance habits ‚Äî they require premium fuel, premium oil, fluids, parts, etc. to keep them going for a reason.

$20m McLaren F1 long tail 

$11m McLaren F1 short tail

$9m Ferrari 330? (The 1967 race car)

Just to name a few.

I really hope PD had plans to add back some of the classic mainstays of the legacy games like the Toyota GT ONE, Nissan R390, Panoz Esperante GTR, Chrysler Viper GTSR team Oreca, BMW V12 LMR, Saleen Mustang race car, BMW M3 race car, etc.

I just picked up the Mercedes CLK LM and it feels incredible but it has no competition in my customs because I don't own the long tail f1 yet.

"The Warka Vase or Uruk vase is a slim carved alabaster vessel found in the temple complex of the Sumerian goddess Inanna (Ishtar) in the ruins of the ancient city of Uruk, located in the modern Al Muthanna Governorate, in southern Iraq.

 Like the Uruk Trough and the Narmer Palette from Egypt, it is one of the earliest surviving works of narrative relief sculpture, dated to c. 3200‚Äì3000 BC. Simple relief sculpture is also known from much earlier periods, from the site of G√∂bekli Tepe, dating to circa 9000 BC.

The bottom register displays naturalistic components of life, including water and plants, such as date palm, barley, and wheat. On the upper portion of the lowest register, alternating rams and ewes march in a single file. The middle register conveys naked men carrying baskets of foodstuffs symbolizing offerings. Lastly, the top register depicts the goddess Inanna (Ishtar) accepting a votive offer.

Inanna stands at the front portion of the gate surrounded by her richly filled shrine and storehouse (identifiable by two reed door poles with dangling banners). This scene may illustrate a reproduction of the ritual marriage between the goddess and Dumuzi, her consort that ensures Uruk's continued vitality.

The vase depicts an example of hierarchy being a portion of nature, and, according to anthropologist Susan Pollock, shows that social and natural hierarchies were most likely akin to each other in ancient Mesopotamia.

The Warka Vase was one of the thousands of artifacts which were looted from the National Museum of Iraq during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. In April 2003 it was forcibly wrenched from the case where it was mounted, snapping at the base (the foot of the vase remaining attached to the base of the smashed display case.

The vase was later returned during an amnesty to the Iraq Museum on 12 June 2003 by three unidentified men in their early twenties, driving a red Toyota vehicle.",0.024968795,0.8857109,0.08932026

"1. Live frugal(minimalist, dont worry about how your life looks on the outside, focus on your priorities and the progress your making)
2. Spend less than you earn(set goals for each, 1 yr,2yr,3yr, and 5yr goals. Make high goals, even if you dont make it, you'll be closer than you think)
3. Don't let your pay raises dictate how much to spend. Find out how much you need to live and keep to it while progressing through your career.(avoid lifestyle creep)
4. Live with your parents to save enough so you can buy your own place. 3.25% down payment with a FHA loan. Hopefully you can buy a duplex to rent and help pay your mortgage.(If you have to rent away from parents house, find the cheapest and save like a madmen till yoi can buy your own)
5. Dont buy a new car, buy a used one.(do your research, there's a reason 30% of the cars you see are toyotas and hondas..)
6. Focus on buying appreciating assets(house), not depreciating ones( like a car)
7. Start an IRA or Roth IRA, look it up, and do your best to maximize( the difference between you investing $10,000 to a 30yr old needing to invest roughly $25,000 to match your same amount. In other words, money is cheaper when your younger)
8. Find a way to stop trading your time for money. Most financial wealthy proritize getting their money to make money for them(passive income)
9. Technical college can go a long way for a lot cheaper. 2 yr for an a&amp;p license( aircraft technician) is starting around 50,000 in most places. (Aviation industry is booming and is in dir√© need of mechanics and pilots,most people dont realize thats an option without a college degree)

"Where to start

Sister had gone through 3 cars. 2 different gen Ford focus cars. One as a total loss after a small issue and the other accident prone. Additionally she had a jeep in the 90s and it was actually really solid. 

Mother had a ford car in the 90s. POS. Chevy in the 2000s and was always in the shop twice a year for electrical and system issues. Has a Toyota for a decade and has had 1 major issue. 

Father had a nissan in the 90s and was in the shop all the time. Had a honda civic in the early 2000s and it was fine. Currently a subaru and had a few issues. 

I had a Toyota as a first car and it took beatings and kept going on minimal maintenance. Currently in a scion, which was owned by Toyota, and it's still not had an issue. The car is 8 years old. 

So Toyota is looking pretty good. The wife had one of those plagued nissan cars and we got her into a Toyota. It's been fantastic.

 For me, reliability reigns surpreme on getting a car because I keep my cars over 11 years. I upgraded only because technology changes were massive. The car runs so well my friend drives my first Toyota and it's coming up on 20 years of life.",0.16506009,0.5961345,0.23880547

Good Bash plates are essential...first beach trip destroyed my rear bumper as without the rear plate they act like a scoop in sand and rip the clips out.  
Factory Bash plate did a terrible job of protecting my intercooler.  
Just get a set of Boos or Bushskinz and be done with it.

If you want to do a lot of towing, go to MM Auto and get the AutoMate Pro kit...changes the transmission shift points in tow mode to keep transmission temps down and has a torque converter lock up mode that makes it behave almost like a manual in sports mode.  
Add their paddle shift kit and you have fingertip control in the bush in low range. 

Google ""vlad mod"" for a plug and play kit that allows you to shut off traction control on demand, plus allows you to keep traction control active up front when the factory rear locker is on...almost as good as twin locked. 

Nautia Engineering makes replacement panels to ditch the useless cubby flap under the air con controls...7 switch panel, actually useful cubby, mounts for brake controllers, whatever you want. 

The one Achilles heel of the 4M41 is the intake manifold choking up with soot...combination of EGR soot and PCV oil mist.  
Catch can will take most of the oil mist out, but needs draining regularly and crappy ones can cause backpressure and oil leaks.   
EGR defeat will remove the soot and stop the problem, but is not legal.   
Turning EGR off in the ECU is the best way. Most expensive though.   
Plug and play cable like Munji is not too expensive, easy to do, easy to remove before servicing etc.

Hey guys, Im an 18 year old soon to be college student and have been looking for a good reliable car. I found a 2015 toyota corolla S with 140k miles for 10,800 on facebook marketplace from a private seller that looks good. I have already test driven it and everything, and if I decide to move forward I will of course have an inspection done. 
I want the car to last me the next 10 years while still being economical. Is the corolla a good deal? Or should I look more and try to find something else with a little lower mileage?

"Not really. Hiphop still takes a certain level of skill to produce it and there are other things that go into the creation orter than just pressing  a button  and asking the machine to make a song. Anyone can make a child with no skill could make AI art piece if they're old enough to use a computer and addiotionally hip hop is often combined with rap, dance or singing  and a human  creates the lyrics, choreography, ect ect. Same with pop. Your argument is closer to that of digital art vs traditional medium tbh and most people understand that digital art still needs art skills. I've used an AI art creator just to check it out. I could literally type in ""bear with pink hat"" and get a completed piece in less than 60 seconds and not do anything skill related. Its nit even art, its an advanced  search engine that creates what you're  looking for and is devoid of any semblance  of human soul and should not be allowed in spaces for art, it should be contained to its own space and it definitely shouldn't be trainef on stolen art from someone who did the work.

I didn‚Äôt feel having a Toyota was worth the significantly more kms/age.  From what I read as well the Pajero Diesel engine is actually more reliable compared to that model prado.

Ultimately though it‚Äôll come down to your subjective taste on style as well as how they feel to drive.  I encourage you to test drive both and go from there.

In comparison, the cost of bananas can vary depending on factors such as their quality, seasonality, and location. Assuming an average cost of $0.50 per banana, the same volume as 3,185.41 Toyota Corollas would cost approximately $44.6 million.

 - VW (cela grupacija sa VW, Seat, Skoda, Cupra, Audi, Lamborghini, Bentley, Ducati, Porsche) 11.4%

 - Toyota 7.3%

Uzevsi u obzir ove brojeve, i cinjenicu da Toyota ima Market Share u Nemackoj od samo 2.2%, jasno ti je da ostatak civilizovane evrope kupuje iskljucivo Toyota automobile, uzevsi u obzir da je Toyota i dalje prva po kolicini prodatih vozila u svetu ispred VW i Tesla (Tesla vodi po zaradi trenutno) 



Ako hoces NAJSTEDLJIVIJI auto, kupi Daihatsu sa 3 cilindra. 

Daihatsu = Toyota 

Glavne razlike izmedju modela ove dve firme su to sto Daihatsu igra na jednostavnost, gde imas takvu pojavu da njihovi 3-cilindricni motori mogu da rade bez ikakve elektronike (ne racunajuci Injektore) sto je danas nezamislivo za moderna kola. VVTI motori ne idu u Daihatsu, jer Daihatsu cilja na 2 vrste vozila u Japanu

 - Kei Kar (naziv za male gradske aute koji su umanjeni do te mere da taman prolaze regulaciju da izadju na autoput) 
 - Van/transport vozila 

Stim receno, svaki Daihatsu model ima dostupne delove, i sve sto je potrebno jer veoma puno stvari uzima od Toyota-e

Ideje za takav auto: 

Daihatsu Sirion (Boon) - od 2004 godine pa nadalje, ide ta verzja Sirion-a koji se u japanu zvao Boon, i daleko najstedljiviji auto je koji mozes da kupis. U zavisnoti od godista, mozes ga naci od 2500, do 4500. Prepakovan Yaris / Aygo, skoro kompletna mehanika od Toyota-e, uz taj poseban 1.0 motor benzinac koji trosi **ispod 3 litre kombinovano** (ne, ne preterujem) 

Daihatsu Trevis (Mira Gino, L650) - radjen inspirisan retro automobilima, [izuzetno atraktivnog dizajna](https://clickandcars.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2bc5328d23b7c1162047cbd8f5c02912-1.jpg) koji trosi JOS manje od Sirion-a, usled cinjenice da tezi svega 810 kilograma sa istim motorom. Trosi kombinovano 2.5-2.7 litre sto je neverovatno svima koji nisu imali prilike da voze auto. 

Eto ako ti znaci. rodjeni brat vozi Trevisa, uzet sa 120k, sada ima 170k, apsolutno nista osim malog servisa nije radjeno, a licno sam ga vozio i nejasno mi je koliko moze da predje a da u njega sipas par litri benzina 

Oba pomenuta mozes uzeti 2010 godiste otprilike za oko 2500-3000 eur, i pritom da dobijes top stanje, mi smo platili Trevis-a pre 4 godine 2800, a dobili smo uvezen iz Holandije, u bukvalno fabrickom stanju, kao da niko nije usao da prdne u njega nikad, kamoli da je ostavio ikakve tragove, auto dosao sa fabrickim enterijerom, maksimalno ocuvan",0.05982952,0.85630023,0.083870254

"Jeg h√•ndplukker ikke data - jeg giver dig nogle af de st√∏rste bil producenter i verdenen som eksempel.
Jeg ved nogle af dem selv laver enkelte el biler, og batteri teknologien er en som vi allerede har til r√•dighed i dag, s√• den er ‚Äòlet‚Äô at g√• til.
Derfor s√• mange nye bil producenter pludseligt dukker op - fordi det er en ret simpel ting at tage fat p√•.

El biler er her for at blive.. det ben√¶gter jeg ikke.
Men hundredevis af kg batteri i hver bil?
Opladning af dem alle?

Hvis halvdelen af danmarks befolkning i dag gik ud og k√∏bte en el bil, ville vi ikke have str√∏m eller et el net som kan h√•ndtere det.
Ja, der bliver arbejdet p√• det, men.. det er lidt en kortsigtet l√∏sning.

Brint bruger ogs√• el-motorer.. forskellen er bare at du ikke skal bruge hundrede KW str√∏m til at oplade.. og du ikke skal have fattige folk som skal ofre deres liv og sundhed p√• at grave giftige metaller op.. men selv hvis disse metaller kunne udledes p√• en fornuftig m√•de, er det stadigt en ressource vi l√∏ber t√∏r for inden l√¶nge, hvor imod f.eks. En brint bil med el motor, bruger vand.. og udleder vandet tilbage i atmosf√¶ren.. 

Toyota har brint bil klar, men vi har n√¶sten ingen steder hvor man kan tanke den, fordi al fokus er p√• el ladere.. fordi det er det som er hot og popul√¶rt lige nu (s√• jov, jeg fik da ogs√• k√∏bt nogle tesla aktier i god tid osv, fordi det var √•bentlyst), men om 5-10 √•r?

Batteridrevne el-biler kommer til at v√¶re sv√¶re at retf√¶rdigg√∏re.

"As a mechanic: Almost all cars from any brand is just as reliable as the next, with notable exceptions. The reason one brand may appear more reliable than another, specifically Toyota, is actually because of the culture of the owners. Toyota owners are far, far more likely to perform their maintenance on time and as recommended than any other brand out there. Conversely, a Chevy truck owner is likely to put off a simple oil change for 20k miles and then wonder why they need major work at 60k. Ford owners have a tendency to care for the engines but completely neglect the driveline and suspension, then complain that they blow transmissions and wheel bearings or balljoints prematurely. 

Now for some raid fire advice from a mechanic: Toyota from 22 and 23 are absolute trash and as a Toyota tech I cannot believe they actually rolled that garbage out. Never buy Landrover, period. Avoid anything Italian as a daily driver, but when they do work they're amazing so go ahead and get one for the weekends (if you're rich enough i guess). Keep buying Japanese, except 22 and 23 Toyota and anything Nissan with a CVT. Buy German, but only ever take it to a shop that's actually equipped for them, they require special computers, training, and repair manuals because the common scantools can't interface with all of the systems in them, and the common repair manuals don't even have the most basic information needed to accurately diagnose and repair one. That's where their bad reputation actually comes from, not a lack of quality. German cars actually are built very differently using different approaches than American or Asian cars are. And for the love of all that is good DO YOUR MAINTENANCE!",0.10092601,0.49754155,0.40153244
"I drive a shit ton of miles and I'm a reformed non-oil changer. I had a used toyota rav4 for about 2 years and sold it to buy a new, less expensive and smaller car, since i'm not a car person but I was racking up the miles. I was mad because I expected i'd take a loss on it.

when I sold the rav4, a mechanic met me to look at it ... he was the one who would decide if his boss who owned the dealership wanted to buy it and decide the price. 

he opened the hood and looked around and said ""wow. someone has really babied this engine. this is amazing, I never see this."" 

that was me, with full synthetic oil changes because I drive so much. he offered me more than i'd originally paid for it. I didn't start out doing full synthetic changes the first time I took it in. But when I was back a month later having driven 10,000 miles already, when the sticker on my window said I shouldn't have to go back for another two months, the guys suggested it. I looked into it and agreed, because I planned to keep the rav4 until the wheels fell off. 

so i'd say, caveat -- if you tend to keep your cars for a pretty long time (and assuming you're a high mileage driver), it might be worth the short-term cost to spring for full synthetic oil changes, or maybe even teach yourself to do them. 

Fast Lube Plus (there are many around) is the place i've gone to forever. they usually run a $15 off coupon every few months. I hold out for one to drop and take the car in. :) same guys have been working at the one I go to for almost 10 years now. they're good people.

u/katymae123 I saw what you said about your apartment complex, you could of course find another place to do it but most people don't. as someone said below, with a warehouse club membership you probably could do it cheapest, but most people (self included) are willing to trade off the cost for the time.",0.41933602,0.47928455,0.10137935

"If you're driving it far, I would recommend a min-van. They will outperform anything on a cargo platform in fuel economy by a lot. Even going as far back as the early 2000s, any  minivan will get 24-25 MPG highway. By comparison, 2WD Astros are sub-20 mpg highway and cargo vans (chevy express, etc) top out around 15 mpg highway.

So in terms of initial cost, space, and fuel economy, minivans are hard to beat.

I don't think there's a huge difference in reliability between different brands of minivans. Even brands known for reliability, like Honda and Toyota, have some issues with their minivans, particularly with transmissions. In my experience, any difference in reliability is priced into the purchase price of those vehicles (and then some). I think the difference in reliability between North American and Japanese manufacturers is generally overestimated in vehicles made post-2000.

That's not to say that you should avoid those vehicles either, I would just also consider domestic options. Something like a Grand Caravan will be cheaper than a Sienna, and they are so ubiquitous that parts are easy to come by and they're cheap to service. Just be sure to get a per-purchase inspection on whatever vehicle you are interested in.",0.027632136,0.29094836,0.6814195

For Marines, I admit I was probably thinking of Navy Seals, and Jocko Willink's book extreme ownership.

He talks about how leaders take ownership for the problem, even if someone under them did the action. I don't think it's different in the Marines at the higher levels.

Yes, even in the military ""shit runs downhill"" in terms of chewing someone on out, but really better run uphill in terms of ownership of the issue.

First, the AWD Siennas in OP's price range are all ""true"" AWD systems by your definition since Siennas have been offered with AWD loooooong before they've been offered as hybrids.

Secondly, explain what you mean by it being ""not as effective"". AWD on a minivan is mostly required to get going from zero on a slippery surface and in many ways, electric is *better* for that - full torque at zero RPM and much faster traction control response are huge advantages over the dated mechanical system on the Pacifica.

Thirdly, the Toyota implementation is superior in many ways. It allows for better packaging, better MPG, regen braking, better low speed performance, less parasitic loss, easier tire maintenance (don't  need to replace all 4) - it's a better system for the type of people buying a minivan.

There‚Äôs usually scammers on there. But not all. If your friend has a friend who knows cars, have that person tag along to look at anything and advise her on appropriate offer. Also, if she finds something she likes, even if it‚Äôs just a few thousand dollars, have her skip carfax and call her bank and ask the bank to do a background on the car. Carfax only knows what‚Äôs been reported. Banks that loan money for cars have a means of finding out everything about the car, reported or not. My bank saved me from buying a totaled Honda accord one time. The carfax said no accidents and the price was good. I called my bank and asked if they could do a background check for me. As I‚Äôm a long time customer, they did. Turns out the car was totaled. Those older Hondas and Toyotas, don‚Äôt get scared off by high mileage.

"Look, kid, I wouldn't have even responded if I looked at your post history beforehand.  You have some strange fetish with the auto industry and its presumed demise.

I said you may be wrong or right, but its still your opinion.  I have my opinion based on experience and going through two major recessions in this business previously.  I can tell you that in this business, things are never as good or as bad as they seem.

What lenders told you specifically they are going to ask for proof of income or cut back LTV's?  Because I deal with all my bank representatives monthly, if not weekly, and I know what they have told me.  They want business, thats how they make money.  If a bank asks for POI, fine, I'll get it.  Lending is extremely competitive, the cost of money limits the lender but there are still a lot of well qualified buyers out there.  And speaking of the cost of money, the fed is at 4.8 right now, which is still below the last 20 year average.  Inflation on autos is a real thing, but the cost of money is pretty much about normal.  The last 10 years of a fed rate below 1%  is not the norm.

Toyota and Honda are not the only manufacturers struggling to keep up.  Here at Ford,, I'm fighting every day to try and get more inventory.  But the fact is that most manufacturers have decided to lower production in the future.   A manufacturer may sell less cars, but they are selling those cars without having to put large rebates on the hood.  Those rebates costs the manufacturer money.

And floorplan has been mentioned here a lot.  Yes the cost of floorplan has gone up, but the other side of that is dealers are stocking less cars while making more on them.  I also get credits from the manufacturer, so floorplan rates do not scare me.  Its just another part of the business to manage.

"Otto Anderson, a 63-year-old widower, lives in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After retiring from a steel company, he plans suicide, having lost his wife Sonya, a schoolteacher, six months previously.  
  
During a suicide attempt by hanging, he is interrupted by his new neighbors: Marisol, Tommy, and their two daughters, Abby and Luna. Otto has flashbacks to his past; years previously he tried to enlist in the army but was rejected due to his hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He meets Sonya on a train after returning a book she dropped.  
  
Otto attempts suicide again, this time via carbon monoxide poisoning. He experiences a flashback to a dinner with Sonya, confessing to her that he is not enlisted in the army due to his heart condition and does not have a job, prompting Sonya to kiss him. Marisol disrupts Otto's suicide attempt, asking him to take her and her kids to the hospital after Tommy fell and broke his leg using a ladder Otto had lent to him. Otto reluctantly agrees.  
  
Otto has a flashback to his graduation when he asked Sonya to marry him. During a suicide attempt by train, an old man faints and falls on the railroad tracks. Otto saves the man and the incident goes viral. Otto takes Marisol for a driving lesson and they visit Sonya's favorite bakery, which the couple formerly frequented every weekend. There, he tells her about his friendship with a man named Reuben, the two having worked together to establish rules and order, with Otto as chairman of the neighborhood association board. The two grew apart after Reuben's preference for Fords and Toyotas over Otto's Chevrolets and the ""coup"" of replacing Otto as chairman. Reuben, who had a stroke, now uses a wheelchair and is cared for by his wife Anita and neighbor Jimmy.  
  
A local transgender teen, Malcolm, recognizes Otto as Sonya's husband while delivering newspapers and circulars in the neighborhood. Malcolm cuts through Otto's disgruntlement at receipt of the newspapers and recounts that Sonya was his teacher, and one of the few people who accepted him as he was. A friendship forms between the pair and Otto fixes Malcolm's bicycle. After dodging a social media journalist named Shari Kenzie who is attempting to interview Otto in relation to the earlier viral video, he gets angry at both Marisol and a Dye &amp; Merika real estate agent, not wanting to come to terms with Sonya's death. He attempts to commit suicide by shotgun, but is interrupted by Malcolm, who asks to spend the night after his father kicked him out.  
  
Otto learns that Dye &amp; Merika is planning to force Reuben into a nursing home and take their house, after illegally finding out that Anita was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Otto agrees to help Anita and Reuben. Marisol refuses to assist Otto until he tells her that he and Sonya went to Niagara Falls to celebrate Sonya's pregnancy. On the bus back home, they were involved in a crash, and Sonya became paralyzed and had a miscarriage. The neighborhood was not accessible to Sonya and Otto was voted out of the chairmanship after a heated confrontation with a Dye &amp; Merika representative. Otto wanted to put all of the real estate companies out of business but decided against it to care for Sonya. With the help of the neighborhood and Shari Kenzie, Reuben and Anita are able to keep their home.  
  
Otto collapses and is taken to the hospital, where he lists Marisol as his next of kin. After being told by a cardiologist that Otto's heart is too big, she laughs, before going into labor and gives birth to a son.  
  
One day, Tommy notices that Otto did not shovel the snow on his walkway. Marisol and Tommy enter Otto's house to find him dead, having succumbed to his enlarged heart. A funeral is held, attended by his neighbors. In a letter to Marisol, Otto says that his lawyer will give her his bank accounts, providing them with enough money to take care of her family, along with his new car and house.",0.43134606,0.5510224,0.017631501

So my default response is exactly your statement here "" every year there is a doom and gloom forecast of something that is going to throw off sales"".

And you're absolutely right, I'm just random person on the internet with another opinion. I should be immediately discounted and thrown in the pile of them.

But you also did say ""there's also a lot wrong with what you're saying"" and then proceeded to not really provide much of any detail which is sort of what I was asking for.  


Now that said:  
\-Cash for Clunkers may have been busy for you, but in aggregate it was still slower in sales for the country than years prior and after. So other places clearly didn't share your experience if you believe the data.  
\-I'm not discounting people that want newest models, total loss vehicles, etc. because I didn't predict no sales. I predicted (and I think quite generously) 13M in sales for 2023. I'm saying that a slowdown in sales + more used inventory + more sitting new inventory = lower margins and low volume = dealers cutting back on costs and staff headcounts. Of course there is still going to be total loss replacements and people who can afford brand new cars all of the time, but at the margins a lot less demand can still very much hurt dealers and the car sales profession.  
\-So compare lending standards in 2007 to that of 2022 once. Compare delinquencies in 2008 to that of the last few months. Now tell me how the heck you think that proof of income requirements wont be worse in the next few years ahead vs. 2008-2011. 2008 effectively permanently changed lending standards in the mortgage market &amp; home equity market. The auto lending industry is arguably worse today than mortgage was in 2007 and we're talking a depreciating asset. Not only are you potentially looking at a very strict lending market in the next couple of years, but an above 50% chance that auto dealer lending standards never, ever go back to 140%+ LTV no proof of income ever again.  
\-My point on Toyota and Honda is more that other manufacturers have appeared to have stepped into and filled most of Toyota's supply chain production hole, but given how low production is right now at Toyota there exists on chance that Toyota would ever agree to just remain at these levels. So even if the supply chain affected manufacturers only get back some of their 2019 volume numbers; aggregate production supply could actually go higher than a 1.3M average run rate because of other manufacturers having already filled that void.

"One thing to note is the 8-year warranty is the minimum required by federal law (for EVs and Hybrids) - it's typically not because the OEM is wanting to give that long of a warranty. California has a higher minimum warranty requirement of 10-years.

&gt;Hybrid and EV battery warranty coverage often lasts longer. Federal law requires automakers to ensure EV and hybrid batteries for at least eight years or 100,000 miles.

However, one thing you could do is change the type of battery you can put in it. Most places sell different quality/warranties for the same battery sizes. You can measure out the max physical dimensions for where the battery sits and get the biggest battery for the cheapest price

For instance, most toyotas take a size 35, however, the 24f is almost the same just a few inches wider and taller and puts out more cca, so if you can fit it in the spot it will work.

Very disappointing from Toyota.  I wonder if they will eventually admit that the Primes are also having this problem.

"Walker makes good ones but some have to be welded on.  Search for one that looks like yours.  What you want is a bolt on repair.  The converter should have flanges on the pipes for each end so you can bolt them on.  i got an Eastern one and it dropped right in.  It came with gaskets for each end and the O2 sensor gasket.  You won't need a new O2 sensor.  Anti seize on it if it's one that threads in to the pipe.  If it has a flange with two bolts, you won't need anti seize.  
The converter was an exact replacement for my car.  I had to remove four bolts on the flanges (two each end) plus two nuts for the O2 sensor.  I did have to make a run to the parts store because the gaskets that came with the converter were too small for the Toyota pipes on the engine exhaust side and at the muffler end. Six dollars more.  
I have a pair of ramps.  That made the job a lot easier for getting underneath the car.  You might be able to rent a pair if you don't have them.  

Take a look underneath your car and see how your cat. converter is attached.  That should help you determine whether or not you wish to attempt the task.  Some of them ""get ugly"".

"I used to do quite a bit of flashpacking/car camping back in the day. Some general thoughts:

* Try to keep the daily drive at about ~200km when ""exploring"". I feel this is an ok distance once you factor in breaks along the way (you're on vacation, you probably want to take it slow), time to spend whereever you're heading, plus enough leeway to just stop in random unplanned places you happen to come over during your journey. YMMV, and of course this depends s lot on where you are and what kind of things you are interested in, but in general  - try to avoid days that are nothing but one big transfer from A to B, unless it happens to be your very last day of the trip.

* Get a car big enough to lie down in, and buy an air matress and camping mat. You'll thank yourself in the morning - vacationing is no fun if you have shitty sleeps. A mid-size sedan where you can fold the backseats down (no Crown for you :D) is big enough for one person if you're willing to stick your legs on the center console. Two, you need an estate van at minimum, and also lean up on the luggage. I'd consider a camper since you can split costs and the fee probably isn't much higher  than a sedan for single person. Eye covers also a must,  as are  windshield reflectors in the summer to keep the worst heat out. Just be aware driving a camper can be a bit of a challenge on some of the smaller roads. 

* Not sure how the EV charging network is these days, but otherwise I'd recommend a Toyota Hybrid - put it in park and turn the lights off, and you can  keep the AC on 24/7. It will run on the battery as long as it can, then boot the engine for a few mins to charge the HV battery, and turn itself off again when it feels it's had enough. Fuel costs for a night are very reasonable in my opinion. 

* Best is if you don't set too hard schedules and just have a general plan/direction. Ex, on the ocassions I would book accomodation, I'd often do it in the afternoon  on the same day - you got a car, so you can afford to take the cheaper place  by the backroad. And by not reserving stuff too early you're not locking yourself down to anything too hard, should something interesting come your way before that. 

*  If you really need to be somewhere by X time, consider forking out for the expressway anyway, you'll thank your nerves. For example the entrances/exits to major urban areas are  usually a major pain in the ass of never-ending eternal suburban boredom, and an unenjoyable timesink - remember your vacation time is also worth something, a few pennies for an enjoyable day is worth it. Otherwise I find the expressways generally more boring than the regular highway roads.

*  Sleep: michi no eki or  rest/parking/ areas, or just  parking for random ""view spots"" you come across on less busy roads - there's not much traffic in the evenings anyway. Don't sleep in the city parking lots, and I personally also avoid sleeping in conbini parking lots even though quite many seem to do it anyway. Wash: free natural/campground onsen where ever (google the map), sentos, what have you. Even Some larger michi no ekis have showers. Clothes: coin laundries are everywhere, though I'd recommend booking real accomodation for at least a day or two per week.

The Polestar is a better, more put together, car IMO. Tesla have the edge on battery/range/performance and tech.

"I'm on the road *a lot*. Despite Toyota and Honda being the most owned cars in my area, Western engineered cars far and away are ahead in the numbers of broken down cars I see. 

I've owned 4 ""western"" engineered cars in my lifetime. None of them made it to 200k miles with every recommended maintenance item done on or before the recommended time -- oil changes every 3k miles, no more than 50k miles on a set of tires or replaced at the first sign of tread loss, belts at the first sign of wear, et cetera. All had numerous major issues. Replaced multiple transmissions, whole engine, head gaskets -- you name it. My VW had nothing but non-stop electrical issues.

Contrast that with an Accord that made it to 227k miles, Corolla 174k, Elantra 148k, and Pilot that's at 181k without any major issues. Most expensive item I've had to replace so far were struts on the Accord at $1,500. $32k car and I easily got my money's worth out of it.

"""Car Issues/Money Success""

&amp;#x200B;

\*Copied and pasted from a post awaiting approval\*

About two weeks ago I went to Home Depot because my main Toyota car key   
broke at the plastic and I wanted to make two spare backup keys.  While   
this was happening a serious storm was forecast to be in the area soon.   
 I got two keys made and was about to leave when heavy gusts of wind hit  
 the store and they announced that we would be locked in until the storm  
 passed over.

The few customers that were there waited about 30 min with the employees  
 in the break room and then they announced that the tornado had passed   
and we were free to leave despite in raining hard.  I walked out of the   
store and saw a transformer across the road explode.  I ran out to my   
car at the other end of the parking lot and expected to casually drive   
home.  It wouldn't start.  Basically, a Home Depot employee ended up   
giving me a ride home which I was quite thankful for.

Once home I was quite dejected about the whole situation because I got a  
 jump start with no luck so I knew it wasn't the battery.  That night   
before bed I started to breath and affirmed, ""Everything always works   
out for me, God always has my back/this is an easy fix,etc"" and while I   
felt the feeling of cortisol and stress hormones I thought from a   
vantage point of ""You're getting yourself all worked up for no reason,   
it's taken care of"".

I went to sleep and the next day I called my insurance for a tow to the   
car shop of my choice.  Asked how much it would cost.  100$.  I texted   
some local friends and 1 or 2 of my gym clients if they were working.    
One of my gym clients was free...asked wassup, what do you need, etc and  
 I asked if I could get a ride to the shop I dropped my car at.  Gym   
client said, ""I have a car sitting in the warehouse, wanna use it""?  So I  
 ended up getting a free Escalade for like 4 days.  Didn't have to rent a  
 car.  Checked my bank balance and was never charged for the tow.  When I  
 opened my insurance app it had an ad which mentioned ""are you bundling   
your car and renters insurance""?  I had a renters insurance payment   
coming up that would be 217$.  I did a quick preview and with my company  
 I would only pay 5$ extra a month.

I quickly cancelled my renter's insurance that was $217 and bundled my   
car insurance and paid 60$ for the whole year.  It apparently also took   
10$ a month off my car insurance.  I also texted my landlord about   
overcharging for one of the months of rent and was able to get them down  
 150$ at the beginning of this last month.  I missed a day of work- $100  
 but ended up making $370 + whatever a rental car would have cost.    
Turned out my car didn't need a new battery or some major engine fix it   
was just a microchip in the toyota key that was bad and was replaced.    
\-40$!

The strange thing about this story is I have had multiple similar car   
successes like this manifesting easy fixes or strange circumstances to   
pay for a fix- won 300$ on a $1 scratch off literally leaving a car shop  
 after getting an engine diagnosis while other desires seem to kind of   
float in the mists of time lol but i'm still applying and believing   
regardless :)",0.16426075,0.7897898,0.045949474

"&gt;I seriously doubt big auto can catch up ever. Tesla spends more on R&amp;D per vehicle than anyone

The only reason they spend more on ""R&amp;D per car"" is because they don't sell as many cars as other brands. Tesla spent $3.075B in R&amp;D last year, GM spent $9.8B in R&amp;D, Ford spent $7.8B in R&amp;D, VW-group spent ‚Ç¨18.9B (~$20.4B) in R&amp;D, Toyota spent $9.3B in R&amp;D.

""Big Auto"" will certainly catch up and I think it's silly to doubt that possibility.

"I had airlift performance suspension on 2 different cars (2012 Subaru WRX and 1991 Toyota Celsior) years ago and daily drove one. Assuming things are only better nowadays with the nicer sensors, dampers, etc:

It‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôll be a bit stiff if you really want to lay the car down to frame when airing out since you‚Äôll have to inflate a bunch to be drivable for regular daily stuff. Think of it like a basketball, more air is more stiff. But more air also means more height (to a point). 

I drove the WRX with air suspension for 3 years in New England winters, 50 miles daily commute, and ski trips. So it took all the salt and everything just fine. I was lucky and there was a touch less wash near my work with undercarriage spray I would hit once every 2 weeks. I installed it myself and the air lines I ran inside the car, not outside. The fronts I put through the grommet for all wiring from engine bay to inside, then ran them along the door sills and through the back seats. Never had a line corrode or get damaged once. Regular maintenance is good: drain the tank every so often and get a water trap. 

Overall it‚Äôs a little more to think about than regular coilovers but it‚Äôs fine. The dampers aren‚Äôt anything special so don‚Äôt drive often ultra low air or even too high of air.
